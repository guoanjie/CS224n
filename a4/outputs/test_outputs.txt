You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, and you read in the U.S.
And I always tell the people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as farmer, or with leather leather and nobody has ever chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk today about circles and <unk>
And you know that <unk> is generally something that fell into one place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school, in the average school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare in class.
When I went to bleed up to bleeding every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the bathroom in the front room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, to half the night I got a phone call from that teacher -- the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I am aware that adults never come to know us.
Could you go to Ohio and please bring that man that you have already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about it was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the theirs.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked to you a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to realize that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> to me around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on a <unk> on another <unk> of snow after year.
The <unk> are born when they come out of the glaciers or you break the ice barriers.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to surrender and they hold up to the end, whereas others can't get more and more <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated from and alone, as well as we see ourselves as a human.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg, a iceberg, releases fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come out to photograph these <unk> as if it was all the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique moments there are only in that way, and they won't be going to be able to exist in that way again.
This is not the death when you're <unk> it's not a end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few photos I would like to show you are from a iceberg who photographed by Greenland.
It's very unlikely to actually come to the <unk> iceberg in the <unk>
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, at the same moment, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to do it too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of knowledge, they won't pay me attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins the X X <unk>
Both of them, and you start life.
We're going to talk to them later.
In my gut activity that will be <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people are taking the anatomy -- which is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids the idea of <unk> what have been thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social rules.
I've been working, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex -- individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into the male <unk> and conventional female <unk>
In short, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of shapes.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having an sex who is not <unk> in the normal forms of male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene on the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life of <unk> that will become <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops following a <unk> course.
When <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing <unk> they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, like men, we have something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I -- I consider a <unk> woman -- I don't know her <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the brain more exposed to <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and she had sex with her, he had a life as a kid and he had just figured out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the <unk> and the uterus -- the <unk> glands, they were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitalia were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at age 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with bacterial chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> that is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't know well why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies would be <unk> twins, <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> to <unk> surgeries is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we were going to get to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea of a particular anatomy of anatomy -- a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is having a <unk> identity -- <unk> being black wants to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you look at a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in a same body.
The latest case is last year in the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put his sex in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test to determine whether to be able to figure out whether or <unk> is male or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such one.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were a stable <unk> categories that was <unk> directly with <unk> categories.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of course, in just a few <unk>
And as we think about it in science we get more and more in a <unk> area where we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in order of life.
It's hard to fix a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still not <unk>
If I stopped moving through it.
But today we can, for example, extract life organ from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we need to deal with the dilemma of actually really the death of someone. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be giving someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan, of gay <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so <unk> in what they did, and I find myself every very long watching that <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
The fathers <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did, it was a <unk> concept.
And as all of you remember, what our fathers were, <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know about DNA, but they had clear the idea of the birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming from the copyright right from the father of the father and the father and then the son, etc.
Founding fathers rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the field of game and decided that the anatomy that mattered to the common anatomy and not <unk> <unk> That was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they become part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> the science.
And there's very clear of course, if you look at the story of fathers -- <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a kind of <unk> right of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at you, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement has been involved with people from <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that are going to give the coincidence of <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we hold certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we had to stand forward to anatomy.
I don't mean by the age of five years, they were supposed to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and that I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures -- at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both of them in the <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term: was born one from March 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months earlier before Mary are attribute every three of the rights three months before Henry -- the right -- the right -- the right to sexual consent sex -- the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I do not tell you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of which Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for his part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry all states, for example.
Henry can be married in every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science is going through both in the field of anatomy that we came up with the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people get caught in a weird position.
For example: Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have chromosome -- and that to marry a woman has to have a <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make tests with people who are going to do to people.
But this is also very strange about the story that I told you to the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very <unk>
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we had to deal with this for human rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions, smart and <unk> about their sex relationships that people in 40 I know.
So how do you put in practice the subject of <unk>
It turns out very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to actually get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that America continues to drive this current sense of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live -- for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless you are willing to submit to a change of sex, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that had done a <unk> twins, and then pick them out, and then <unk> your name.
But when the phone asked him to ask the surgery, he was a very <unk> operation, and he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So what I said, "Well, it's considered the political <unk> rather than the separation <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are <unk> to change by the very well of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish up I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about group.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigate the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is differences between men and women in terms of the way of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to social social relationships and care of those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism -- <unk> as <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
What are the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
feminism has to be able to get rid of <unk> <unk> so there's no female on the <unk>
But the more I thought about her question, the more I think there's something else in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to social social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the fathers were very aware to find the way to protect people in part of the state, we may have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we had enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we think about democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity and thinking more in relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far from that goal.
There are billions.
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily go to the world <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just took out of buildings.
Imagine that half of the ones that would like to live in apartments are either owners and the other half will still benefit from it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the standards of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place to build a brand new apartment building, and when the rules of that place would be built in the building instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that authoritarian governments -- new leadership zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later, I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year around <unk> <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> I went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following election <unk> <unk> <unk> became <unk> with a platform in which they were <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and join all the current residents in apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of the technologies like <unk> <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us will go forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a bond with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we sat together in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with a <unk> terrain.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to do this project, this might be the way for our country to make our country.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that would measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North north.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the government leaders of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with helping them to establish and make the standards of <unk> so that they could all be confident that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily cover a thousand square miles.
And so soon later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional available available available situation that would allow these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional constitutional <unk>
All of the ones are <unk> all the ones in society, <unk>
By <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed on another voting on <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on the 21st of February, a delegation of 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is building in Korea in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this so practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> administrators and it would allow them to operate under a external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go and get a job, sometimes they are mothers who have to make money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friend <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a <unk> public confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, increasingly, and more recently, to photograph and publish my blog <unk> and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to meet people <unk> usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Being from my size?
I would like color like it?
It's less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going on, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside of exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else that I want to use after I got here to <unk> <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you a few of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you a little bit of <unk> you also get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid that you're in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remember it to their little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you're good with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there is no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people approached me this week simply because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to go back to certain things.
I don't need to <unk> these things, because back to the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I looked up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a plane of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical one.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So, where do you get your brain in this scale?
Some of them would take away from one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists are <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
So a intuition that you can have developed with the age of the years is the one that says one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing a parking bar.
It was a little kid and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that play with that parking lot, he taught a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except that you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, parking closely with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really rare -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years, you need of quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But they didn't fit it well to my logical part either.
Because if everything is made out of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why he didn't have been.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit of a little bit on the center.
And then here we make a very big focus on the small <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, and what we see is a springboard -- and that stands on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and put all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people will go up with you to do those things, because I don't want to get them <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues in journey of inanimate objects are not just the light that the lights are, and the wind passing on their side and heat in the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we put a <unk> and pulled up all the air -- and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree above zero zero.
Now, when you were just in the <unk> the little bit of metal is free to act as I want.
So we measure their movements.
We found that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, she was vibrating. And the way that <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving you a smooth drive, we were able to make it <unk> and that you don't go to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up to the top and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
Over the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which at the time means that all of the metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom -- and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that he talks about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it, and we turned the lights and we looked at the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just going to be <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about how quantum mechanics is that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so truth.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head who is here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is explaining simply in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I was a great education -- I didn't have a lot of access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Let me just show you a demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, <unk> are going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the New York Museum in New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you get <unk>
They want to navigate by the <unk>
We opened up the top, and one click of it, we jump into it.
They are inside, which you want to go at the end of the hall,
Let's keep forward <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What are you getting with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is about hitting a <unk> with a <unk> Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull out the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It turns it up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that is the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- we just raised a zooming around.
This is <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like when you look at these pieces of <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its work of art and that is represented properly online.
And the great question I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
You think it's a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian origin all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a race of Formula 1, I took a budget, and you put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough and the pilot were good enough.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, it was <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that control control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're turning computers out to the air.
And as <unk> are beginning to respond differently, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As some note I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms would become sensors and <unk>
And that's fundamentally changing the interaction that humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end of the hammer took the hammer and threw it up to the <unk> -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer that was lucky at 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup on the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at the activity in the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The timeline.
At the early afternoon, there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France. <unk> in Italy.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First of time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and consume.
Today we know everything about the side of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a god, how they were <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of little tags to track the trash in their shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to label what were different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
And then we put a little chip, and we put a <unk> to the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same as much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> didn't exist, it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we <unk> one day still goes there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is actually going on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water in the water in public spaces.
And the question was: how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you go down the pixels in them, you can write patterns, patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain is going to open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design a building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There's no windows and no windows, but when you get up to it is open to you to be able to happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind -- if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it's low almost all the architecture goes away.
Here's how it works.
You see the people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way they interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let me happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> and for us that was very interesting because architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels with the pixels of water, and from projections on them.
And this is what led us to thinking about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw earlier, that moves with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud, <unk>
It's kind of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the wall of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, where you can get close, and you can see it from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> from the best ballet dancers of ballet today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left side, you see the <unk> it captures it in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity, and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics in London.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our <unk> environment, like an oyster farm like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could get everybody to do a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what's happened in the last few years is that, in the last two years, we spent the physical world to the physical world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will give us the digital world, we can move from the digital world, of power self-organizing to the physical world.
In our case, this might like we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made out of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered the pixels.
You can move through it, you can have different experiences.
You can see from below, to be able to share the main moments of the London Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
I'd like to be better than what they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they might be improving <unk> by more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe there are those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is you going to tell you.
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people have to play creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> I probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you want memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great feature of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "No biology has sense of the light of the <unk>
But if it effectively embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the most interest that we do.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20  25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk>
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> asked them about <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm up, it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that might want no effort from their own.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush rush to the way.
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what are we <unk>
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That's us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk -- so I hope that you've got this <unk>
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental is in most of the existence of life, in diarrheal organisms, each cell organisms just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two two cells.
But when organisms appear. things start to change.
It goes into scene <unk>
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed a lot of reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still died in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, I was working for a different aim for the goal of <unk> not necessarily a little bit different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy for.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted it to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> we adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everyone <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to be <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily happen to longevity.
They don't necessarily underestimate the greatest or the stronger or the faster and even the more smart and even the smartest one.
Evolution encourages the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean in the bottom of the ocean <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that if there were fish there, fish that would be there, fish -- <unk> -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean -- when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look at the way on, to the <unk> phase, I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to be able to adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that you can produce a evolution of the traditional <unk> natural species, by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when we sort of <unk> planets, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, a third possibility, and there's a <unk> intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and picked up for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you pick up at the individual and familiar.
Think of it as well as it could be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic damage.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
They wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and she sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 million base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to 20,000 dollars, and in a week.
Not a lot to be able to do the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more at the reach of all.
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human resistance in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against the flu <unk> in cells of a drug plant.
Can you imagine something that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or changing the newborn egg <unk> and give your children a better life for a more healthy life, eliminating diabetes, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that can produce the changes in order to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also have <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a <unk> <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options for a better society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For a good time or for worse, and before what it might be, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had had the airplane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more words that I have heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight worker.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before he died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as the bridge -- George Washington, which wasn't for a lot -- I thought about, wow, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that it doesn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mind clock goes <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I did, I had the feeling of, wow, he will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in one thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could grow my kids up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point I understood that two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not dying that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live in another way.
You guys are flying in today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing on your plane -- and please not be so -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What is the thing that you want to do is they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
A day came to her home after running and said, "Dad, feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation -- obviously, graffiti is a little bit intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met with her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody who is important and having a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way, they go <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I introduced myself to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed up a check that I had no idea how he was going to <unk>
I stood up with her brother and her father there at that right moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony goes to talk, we are going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's kind of ridiculous that someone who have so much inside your inner cannot <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research that has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a cycle of life.
They first start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the Bush attacks and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of an organization and a lot to move things from one side to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine so that we could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all the world <unk> from every corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage behind, and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> would have taken the paintings off the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks old, we went to the <unk> walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sunshine that we bought in the shipping tour of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, the <unk> we set up on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds one itself, we build the code -- we published the software <unk> the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There are no hospital that I can say.
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate with just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the room of <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, sessions with all night, Tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of life and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall from the hospital parking lot.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device -- but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends of closing <unk> is that in April this year in April <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it happen.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- stage, the computer, the <unk> the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like you have to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time a very dangerous way.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- a little bit fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations in seemingly horrible appearance with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that are <unk> attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing a way that you see <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, a few messages on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is, and according to the content I could do in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I couldn't afford it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could get rid of -- nothing could be done for something that hard or as dangerous as you go to the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of product and marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything up at the bottom at the end, has pictures of brand, all the time; all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title, <unk>
Now this brand, are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of X brand, but we're going to make sure about using all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe they took a shoe and it becomes the coolest shoe that you've got to be.
The coolest car that you have driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> from "The largest <unk> movie.
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film was full of transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all of the shot shot at the end.
And I would love that to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> Do you have a <unk> I don't know if <unk> is very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million -- <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard to work with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands in a couple of big infrastructure.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside of microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this is one by one, all of these companies were suddenly gone.
None of you want to have anything to do with this movie.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of apart, is not the idea to have that new vehicle that is worthy of attention that will lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a mistake, <unk> and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you're looking for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that would show up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> or easily detected or easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices -- being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to do something it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk> -- like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to give you a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would come up with a lie -- and there he is just he looked at it, like, "Son, there is three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go to my mind, I would have to take out of my own, and go to business myself.
So what I started to figure out suddenly -- that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends that make big films big, giant <unk> and others who make small films like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood film movies say that the reason their films are so successful is due to the objects associated with the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to go to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest <unk> movie.
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're good cool for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man to <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, as it is.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little <unk>
<unk> to the kind of little films that <unk> we are more well a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people of the reason that this is why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something better <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category at positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps it cool.
How do you keep you fresh over time, with better <unk> more <unk> three times more <unk>
They are things like those of the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of common?
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what's the brand <unk>
<unk> A little bit <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like this.
And usually I take pictures like sunglasses, or like <unk> and similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand you could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: In part of you in part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is determined because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to make Tom, Tom, but often I would be inspired by the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think that your world is the world where you think about your friends, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case they start and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> to what does that serve us.
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> do you find now?
Why is it important?
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were getting very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox for them.
And I think some companies are just going to be involved in one of your strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid the fear of those elements -- and you actually give them to <unk> and make it become a positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What else are you like this?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and conscious brands -- those things that have gone and come up with it, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to give you your identity to brand, your personality personality what would be?
You're a <unk> attribute you are someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more well a attribute of <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful being cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold or bold as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> human or mystical like <unk>
Or are you more likely to attribute it.
You're conscious -- sophisticated as <unk>
Are you -- traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar familiar, safe, sacred sacred, or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for the <unk>
We went to St. Paulo where advertising <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the schools in the schools with the problems of available in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've had more success are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their donor <unk> and they said maybe these agencies have no best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people who are going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it left? <unk>
Well, since the film was sent into the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of impressions for this film.
This is just a two-year period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to make momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talk to us talking to their customers not being a part.
I've always believed that if you get a <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people that's pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss aversion
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we need to get to the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of <unk>
From one <unk> at the time, we need to hug the risk.
And ultimately, we need to support transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my care for the TED year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus out of Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> this gray, <unk>
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
<unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the Iranian program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you about how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes. These control systems.
And so we got the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they were very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a lab rat didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then from experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking in an active box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it is effectively working on that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say, for example, a plant of power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two pumps and a little bit of a big one.
We also saw that they were armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
We were all the points that we will attack.
You probably even know how much they would take the operator.
So you know it.
And if you've heard the <unk> of <unk> it is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks like the old language.
I want to tell you about how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were calls on the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a black <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I saw them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell phone inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you deal with the speed of this <unk> you can certainly get it, and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was making it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to decipher the big digital <unk> looking at very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
And the results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would talk to one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really saw me.
There's the gray, and the top box looks like the <unk>
What this thing does is what it does is to intercept the input values of the sensors for example, from the sensors of pressure, and the sensors of vibration and provide code -- which is still running during the attack, with <unk> <unk>
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding video.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a computer security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in a power plant plant, when the big turbine turbine goes down, you have to open <unk> <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can explode.
And I don't have the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a plant plant, or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this payload with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It would be more than possible.
And if you did that, with what you do, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are a spaces with large number of goals.
We need to face the implications, and better than we have to get to work now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
So the engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give them <unk> or the other thing to make users of wheelchair raise them and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're nothing different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force -- that also increases your speed, and help, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect them with the universe and other remarkable things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started by talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back, a load of 45 pounds, and it's been <unk> it will carry even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injury.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- <unk> I can give you 90 pounds of land for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
I know what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of wheelchair, about what I'm particularly passionate passionate about.
There are 68 million people in roughly, in the wheelchair, all over the world.
Like one percent of the population of total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We are also talking about the population that are generated by very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so much for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago, he had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a few sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the board, here on the back.
There are a little bit of batteries that give the motors into the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural road.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all <unk> movement.
Little time later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never come to <unk>
That's 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last little bit of hope of my self.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom <unk> climbing rocks and even set up a bicycle <unk>
But they haven't invented nothing that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not only about soldiers, but Amanda, and all the drug users of the <unk> all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest relatives, closest life.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos shows us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by big, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where death is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the bush <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been done for decades and caused nearly as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> trade and deforestation makes you not fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we are not safe about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden by <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know we know it as the apes -- the <unk> love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots that are <unk> the same <unk> the dance and the <unk>
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you -- but I want to show you a couple of newborn videos of the wild.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football game.
Here we have a female and a female male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what it is.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "It has <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common as much in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust, and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, as it does, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world to greater creativity and larger cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a way that changes we need to play.
But let's get it to the maximum ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans -- life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate to play, it can be the moments in which the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, to embrace this gift of evolution and play together as we can play creativity, and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York -- I'm responsible for a development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain <unk> in a fire department volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers were attributed to a highly skilled staff, one has to get to the fire site very quickly to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a career to foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the gentleman that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- he got first to the captain and he asked him to go into the dog of the owner of the owner of the owner of the owner of the owner of the owner of the owner of the owner of her owner <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building on the phone to save a live living because he won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firemen that at that height more or less had finished the fire and went into the main room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house -- the treasures for the house owner where, as you'd expect, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the brave attempt to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a volunteer firefighter I'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness in a <unk> scale, but also of the <unk> of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are to do this remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't want to remind you.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park in the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save people's lives, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete blocks are built in <unk> with a very simple <unk> modules of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He was called a <unk>
And in a few years, the building bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on a few other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows to create much greater and more complex circuits at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the <unk> the pink is the input and the orange is the <unk>
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make older circuits.
One blue with one green is producing light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a module module that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
We have this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using a very simple <unk>
To make it get faster or slower and slower and slow down this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> to bricks and use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given <unk> to kids to work with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light is like a night, or why the door of an elevator is still open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any experience in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>   A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have some experience in engineering, only in cardboard wood and paper and said, Make something like that.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> barrel of <unk>
But hang on, here comes my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach out of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and invent things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is seeking to get involved with the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> just just a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> can we continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, you know, I have the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending it to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their task is to show you the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant in Boston.
Here it appears as if I was looking at a quote, but what really searches is that someone has to clean up when it stays caught by snow, because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get to ask help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at the time we were very much last year.
They realized that the city would never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that <unk> citizens with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can adopt a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you go back.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest app.
It may be the smallest of the 21 applications that last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads into viral.
A responsible system responsible for the city of the city of <unk> looking at this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work with these <unk> <unk> but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why they ask the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just ran out of <unk> to get people to <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we know nine cities that we have to use it.
And this has spread out without <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that I had done it by the normal channels that would have led to the least two years, about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the moment there has two million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shock of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as the private companies like a lot of people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so we were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to apps for <unk> every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration in front of that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, they line up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us nuts, the government is, in essence, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they were not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy don't <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately grows away from -- you remember that by <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information.
It's the place that calls the phone calls if you make it <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, can you open the doors of the house, put up music and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston has a telephone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that app.
It was the work of very clever people in the New York Office of Boston.
One day, this has actually come up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government income to collaboration voluntary collaboration,
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition technology of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role here.
It connected to the two people.
And I could have it connected with the government services that we need to do, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper new alternative than government services.
When a neighbor help another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same thing that politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think it's the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will take our values and our values and our needs, then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
So that's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us that that we funded as something that is operating on our against, that other thing, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we will have to do that the bureaucracy is sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed <unk> report in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism that's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have been dealing with government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they need to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't take away from government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of the age of our members is 28 years old, so I said, <unk> I'm a larger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who are going to <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express their views on any channel at the same time.
So when we face the government problem we don't care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring it to the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out of it, take a garbage garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody else, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, and in the death row of death.
I've spent most of my life in the communities in <unk> and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told, you have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they're taught with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I don't really learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was a hard thing, but she was also <unk>
When I was a little and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I got so strong that I could barely breathe and then I was <unk>
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I told me, again and if he said yes, I would leave me in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running all over.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
So I looked at him, and he looked at him, but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she stood up in the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on, and he said, "Come on. We both go to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you about it.
I said, "All right, <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I didn't get it, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and I looked down, and he said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to tell you that always the <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you will always do the right right -- even the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I would never be <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field in <unk> <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister a little year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us and me and went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, offered him to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, but I'm not going to get <unk>
My brother said, <unk> -- and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. Don't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I came up with the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, it's not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading a <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who really don't make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been caught during the <unk>
My guys died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, you find so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or a parole.
In the urban <unk> in the entire country, Los Angeles, North Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, Washington -- 50 to 60 of all young people in the prison are in prison or freedom in parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that is a lot better if you're rich and blame, that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results of outcomes.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear politics and anger will make us believe that these are not problems with us.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work well curious.
In my state in Alabama, as well as in my state in Alabama, I would ask for your rights to always if you have a criminal toilet.
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of Black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years -- the level of loss of rights to be as elevated as it was before I <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where he was inspired by 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, and we have a chance of <unk>
We're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They went to people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, we've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified an innocent which is innocent and liberated from the death row of death.
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be allowed to fly airplanes if in every nine that <unk> one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It is interesting that in my classes with students on history <unk> I'm talking about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, was a very defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were concerned about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are the older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, and you say <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our own deal for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of <unk> racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time <unk> each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial segregation without the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's very disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We never have to be here."
The room stayed silently and a lady said, "There's no way with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we were going to put people in the <unk>
<unk> on this.
How would we be able to feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, things that are positive and wonderful things, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're all fascinated by technology.
We love your entertainment.
But lately, those realities are being held by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that will never come to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we need to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. Despite being so rational, so engaged in intellectual <unk>
The development of innovation, the development comes not only about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also for the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places that are in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect with the technology and the design that allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to imagine that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were used to just speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to join us to speak.
Do you want to come and get it.
I said, "Yes, lady. I feel lady.
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
And so I was going to go and just <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, let me tell me this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of me, and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> with simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not that it's a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> not to be judge for our technology, because of our designs, or because of our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they deal with the rich powerful and <unk> and the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound themes about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I'm a lot of force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years old, who have been <unk> to get them to become adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge make a judge to turn someone into what is it?
The judge is <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
One night I was very late -- my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 years old, a tiny, poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> for my black client in 14 years to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I had been involved in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical and a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it had had the sent to court.
So about two months, I had forgotten about two months.
And finally I <unk> my God, I have to go to the court for this case stupid.
I got up to the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went on to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got down the car. He walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black black man, was the <unk> of court.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. I said yes.
So I came up and approached me.
And I was interested in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When he walked in, the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> me." And we started argue.
People started getting to. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen who was <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly I didn't know how, the room was full of people, and I'm all mad because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I came back to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I looked at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge is <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed himself because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black black.
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black guy stood up, looked at the <unk> and looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young woman who keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious question of the audience, in this community, to help in your sense of doing something.
Something that is not a check.
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be a effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today in <unk> policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row over the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases, not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get there.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with that <unk> these funds to make the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, <unk> rates of violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
That's why it comes up with this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into a chain of <unk> to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about me today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some clips of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that media media, prefer <unk> news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than likely the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing makes us more than survive, the first stop of all that data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning <unk> the <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news -- seven days of week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong with the world.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the extinction extinction -- the <unk> of water and <unk> and we have no doubt we have.
As human beings are really good at <unk> the problems and in the long time, we end up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita in inflation has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent of the last 130 percent.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to make it more and higher expectations for you.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
I think a lot of this is the technology and lately, the exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and it's doubling the performance of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time in the war and peace in the peace and peace in the <unk>
It's the fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it curve up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all the planet, synthetic biology, -- the fuel and the food, and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It does play with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everybody in the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single day, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that it is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon from <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> <unk> king of <unk>
The peacekeepers ate with covered with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the <unk> king ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington Center is aluminum <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's linked by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> got <unk> and made of aluminum something so cheap that we use it as a <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 percent energy <unk>
It's not about it, but it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> rupees versus 17,000 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents the <unk> per hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan has pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after the country happened.
<unk> a <unk> <unk> How do you <unk>
"A pale <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in a 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to give me your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It's capable of generating a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> gray, <unk> water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
President of Coke just thought that I'm going to make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have complete confidence in this way, Coca-Cola will be able to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world by the end of 2013.
It <unk> that warrior warrior has better mobile communication communications in Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to have a smart mobile phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted it.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology.
Maybe the best thing comes when the applications are on health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can get these technologies into a mobile device with the talk, and because it has <unk> you can extract blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 to 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus, or DNA that doesn't have to be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just spent the mark of the seven million.
By the way, the best protection of demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds ever before <unk> that you add global conversation.
What will these people?
What <unk> What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education in the Academy of Academy -- and because of the use of impressions in 3D and computer computing will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three million more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
What about some voices never before <unk>
So what if we give the psychopaths wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power for the first time?
What did these three <unk>
And if they are contributions we can't afford it.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small equipment, guided by their passion with an objective of course, can do things that were <unk> things that only could make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important about medical research.
And so far, I was a problem with <unk>
They've played this <unk> professors among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together, and they started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the innovative passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we have been involved in to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we need to do.
We have for a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything about special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still says they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the shift of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
I had <unk> about 20 seconds, the black <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very plentiful and spent for a good moment, so it was more than the average in Ghana.
When I went up 27 years later, the amount of fish had fallen down in half.
<unk> five centimeters.
It will be a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was guilty in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1950s, <unk> started in the <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development meant to impose at the countries that already had 100,000 dollars <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty <unk> is called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish on it, and we took studies in the south of the Sea Sea Sea <unk> and, mostly in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny blobs of <unk> remains that they are fish from coral reef.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing <unk>
The bottom line is going to be a solid coral fund, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Don't the <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to one area where they have never been fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
It takes the start point to the new level, without remembering what was there.
So if you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things that biodiversity, biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate to go forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
They don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the kind of changes.
And at the end to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in a great measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are already not, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they have done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a prime sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, they have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way that they would expect that to have the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of them would like a captain as a captain of the way I looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, or usually they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and it's very low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine protected area and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their point from <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there the arts and cinema may be filling out the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay bay -- 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about it, if you think about how people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why they are <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is to Cameron, <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and watch YouTube <unk>
It's true.
So we're going to see what the videos are made and how videos are made and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed like something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our <unk> copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of the percentage of it is viral gets infinite <unk> and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video from his house in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows rise at the rise of popularity in the past summer.
<unk> was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this urge to get to the <unk>
And the creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> present us and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, I have to start on Friday.   You all want to get to the weekend of a week, the weekend of week.   He would not think I could have this conversation without talking about this video, hope.
<unk> of Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
And just like <unk> -- and this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science was one of the first people to do a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great internal joke then starts talking about that and to do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
So that's it. That's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that aroused between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone made a version of the old version.
And then it became international <unk>
All of a sudden, it came up a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form of.
Because today it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> -- <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
How could it have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video for minute, just that was just that only unexpected and unexpected can tell you the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I'm going to admit that I didn't really bother me too much.
Casey <unk> <unk> me not circular by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you with circular prevent by the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth the new thing we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
So the creators of creative communities in participation, so unexpected, are features of a new media type of media, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular experience.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't get permission to express his ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, they're just the current media -- but we have the future entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been entirely entirely in vain.
So the words, for so much time friends, they now do it.
They were <unk> in silence.
He died <unk>
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I was able to do it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task for his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the sea van <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The fear of fear was the violation of rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
So if we first asked ourselves first of my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> <unk> on every wave, and the vast horizon, <unk>
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I know the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and he died, he was too much for it; and the first apple that I did, given for the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> whose population is comprised of <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class -- whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments was <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> line of cars, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a <unk> title of the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they set up an extra tutoring in English and mathematics, no matter what was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> <unk> it was always a second hand.
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back home.
house, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother suffered <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't make the angry transition and <unk> and <unk> kids caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> I was having a classical student with what I escaped from myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in lives of <unk> tragically, increasingly, drug abuse and abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of a year, I picked up the young Australian young of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, not <unk>
There were a <unk> Lady of <unk> it was now as <unk> refugee and social activist.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb -- <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we went up to the ship.
It never had been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What do you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly <unk> the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were going to live on in the border of possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly <unk> new in the scene -- and not only is good, but it's something that is something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear the world.
<unk> that they would not have been <unk> it was <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, one optimism -- we had a <unk> mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
They went to a small group of people who <unk> no <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They were going to go back at the entrance to night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant, and we open up <unk>
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where <unk> was the social rule and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she and a lot more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop the other side.
I knew I'd come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and ensure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came up and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> your hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand <unk> and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us and how life built us now we can see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could do that for okay?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy to the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave woman in each wave, the <unk> constant rate of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and watch them do this.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of what's here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed from the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians want to travel <unk> to a car, and they would go through the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
In that time when I was born, the Indian warrior Greek warrior had <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And so I was excited about it.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was doing this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
My grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technological technology was to me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, from hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them to <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I got <unk> I came into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
Put the text out with the image, it would animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do is:
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl inside is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, it light your way into what the subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy is that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this is a map.
In all of the fantasy technology, there's always been maps but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain dots of the book also <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and contemporary <unk>
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back in a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with present issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not been out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So in order to recover this childhood ritual that we have to go out and in a chapter, and you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
In this way, you create a whole digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A picture of London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are there many possibilities.
In the next book we have to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through it through and through augmented reality -- it sees a <unk> group that appear on the inner plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are associated with technology and magic and technology is coming to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's something very simple.
It has a breath and it has closed off.
Every morning I was going to look at me.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I get <unk> to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time when you need <unk> or some luck of that style, but I would see it backwards.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can lead to the people of their chairs and together develop some activity in order to have more control of their health.
From the week next week, it will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were going to take care of their homes, take their blood pressure, they will bring them to their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, come back and recover the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of costs of care, <unk> demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video video.
We all have sailing navigation at <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM ATM ATM <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we got <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience, you see a <unk> please look like <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, because sometimes it opens up in the office <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> they can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use his phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to do it to the global level.
We are <unk> to all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us pose these <unk>
They might be text services, or people from <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please <unk> in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first <unk> digital camera.
I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process is when you press the <unk>
For me, photography was more than to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when you press the <unk>
<unk> like this, a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful times, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real.
It's the details or the <unk>
Let's get light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's really not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain out, because the brain is not accepts the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process when we combine the photographs.
It's really different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like realistic and I think they're those in which you don't even know the things that are around us in our everyday life.
But when we combine photographs of this is very important -- because otherwise something is wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to continue to get realistic.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are doing with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect potential.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed by photographs of different places.
And in my personal staff, I think it's easier to create a place that it is because you don't need to put the ideas in danger that have on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try and find out the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The coast is a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made a red line at the top of the top of the island to be more <unk>
So to get a realistic result I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of others that we tend to see, it's a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
Here's a strange thing.
And that's precisely going to speak.
Please switch on the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are technology <unk> technological <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve in which, let's say, these are the years or a unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to do -- the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you think about it, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation is <unk> as fast as the <unk> of <unk> I could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There's no unprecedented in the history of technological development, which every few years of advance of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these <unk> curves that we see you don't have forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
They were just one of two things.
Or it will be a typical curve, I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe I'm going to do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way that you take the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember as a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what happens in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
A transformation. Can we feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because it's all going to be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time in which I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about a few billion years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that are going to get around it.
So if you look at the way that we organized those chemists give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is, at that time, it had floating some oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those oil drops had had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate materials from the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms of oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemical <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that in some ways they were being able to be better at the time to incorporate chemical chemicals -- more chemists -- more chemicals and get more <unk>
Mostly they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life -- very simple -- but things become interesting when these drops really <unk> when these drops the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same <unk> system.
In fact, every living is expressed in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did for <unk> we can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people from the airport.
But <unk> Tom <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this fragment of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years old.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information into the communities of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to become communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage was interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a community <unk>
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not serves without the heart, or the brain cells or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than processing information in community.
They're the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures to understand and understand the information.
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary approach.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because I knew it was sick and got sick and got sick of it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit away.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures so that it accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So, for example, the more <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea that was going on the head.
I'm sitting here sitting there, and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated that we made it in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started making <unk>
We now spend by periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms, our methods of record, presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> the video video -- the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger and faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced certain evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that told them took a billion years each.
The next few pieces of the nervous system and the brain took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that makes its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make conventional way.
I don't know it does every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with designers of <unk> <unk> we think a level of abstraction -- we put it on the machine and the machine with that makes something that before you don't could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes using methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please take a computer, you can run a hundred million <unk> <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, to run all those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more going to get numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely to be some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They were going to get them to the rest.
And now we need the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs -- that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children were taking the properties of the two programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
They were able to add some mutations together.
And it tries to try and get it to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that sequence numbers in such a perfect perfect way.
In fact, it's programs much more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to ask them to see how they work.
These are completely strangers.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that they can get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing it.
I was going to go on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and pull out a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment to analogous to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the end of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was born.
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent long enough to let me give up a part of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about coming out -- the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hopefully many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300, a little bit of <unk> we've got 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who is trying to get to the first base of it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is someone than 10 <unk> beat up.
<unk> as the legendary Ted Williams, the last player from the National League of <unk> in running over 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I think of this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're grandma to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place, and a dear one, has two <unk> arteries and their family doctor brings it to a cardiologist that record in <unk> is 200 percent.
But do you know something?
She's getting better at this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'm going to ask you the question.
What do you believe that it must be the average of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send me to the world, and me included, with the mandate to be perfect.
I'd never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it right.
And that was the message that I was talking about when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studying up to a blood test.
Such you.
<unk> in my little <unk> in my little <unk> in the General <unk> of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> <unk> and the <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from medicine in medicine with the impression that if you take it all, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the lady in the emergency lady where I was working on the emergency service.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when the emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist -- I was going to go to that patient going to me.
And to inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, your blood goes to your lungs, these are <unk> of blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work in the treatment that I read him.
I gave <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> pills so that it could be able to eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent him home.
I actually made two more mistakes more errors.
I sent her home to her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't check the phone and I didn't get what I should have done, which I should have done, I was calling my head and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would pay constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to her home, I didn't take attention to a voice in my inside that he said, <unk> it's not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so sure that I was going to ask the nurse that I would ask Mrs. <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought of it, and then he said <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the top and the ambulance along with the ambulance and the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital, and I walked into the parking lot, where I was my car to go home. At that moment I did something that I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency service service, home.
And there was another nurse, not that I was born from the lady who was <unk> before, but another <unk> said to me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors do.
Other specialists who fear it too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you know what?
"Do the patient remember her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the tall, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> they brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure, which means a shock <unk>
I was just just breathing and it was blue.
And the emergency staff would raise all their resources.
They gave medication to raise your blood pressure.
They put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was hoping against all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that they never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And to the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks earlier, I was excited about it, and I experienced the first time the shame is in our medical culture, and I felt just -- isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it with your colleagues.
One makes peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame you leave a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad enough.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I was doing things like this, and he made sure that I didn't get to me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I send him to your home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little to the feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day <unk> it opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I was wondering if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to get the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, would make it hurt those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, it was a <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my chief asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I spoke the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition.
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
You get <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were invited to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation of it.
And I had an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking the patient <unk> a certain sensitivity in the lower right corner, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He made it liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague of mine who did it.
I checked it and when you notice some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, I called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered and they recovered too.
But every single case was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant people have been over the last five years.
<unk> ashamed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't have to get -- and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to be able to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital, the wrong leg is that I would have a hard time in looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the errors.
It's the system that there are two <unk> who make mistakes and those who do not sleep and those who are not able to sleep, those who have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you go from medicine to people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad litigation and medical failures to learn as possible, from the first paper that I wrote to the Toronto "Star <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs -- in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where respiratory infections are increasingly more and more <unk> by chaos and death.
In this country, dying <unk> Canadian by <unk> medical errors.
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added up every two or three years, and we didn't get to us.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in your chest, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and suddenly my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get rid of it, and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's already a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell you, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The doctor <unk> the human is human, you know the human, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what's happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They hate the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way that they were all <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am a human <unk> <unk>
And I feel a lot about it, but I am effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
And I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to choose a half a half a day.
Not a lot ago, in one research followed by a week to a group of presidents companies.
Researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives and the time that we were going to make decisions about making decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes and how many of an hour?
How do you look at those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems that I want to talk about -- to choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, you just want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for you to give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a park <unk>
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 different water <unk> and this was when you were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asked to ask myself, why never buy nothing?
This is the oil shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> who came from <unk> trees.
One time I decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out of the buses full of tourists which came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment. This is the <unk>
pathway.
They had different classes.
They had a put on the entrance to the store.
We put out there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 flavors and looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Where he stopped when I had <unk> only three percent of us got to buy <unk>
Where you got six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably are probably good at <unk> -- less is good for preserving the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of options will affect us in real decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the <unk>
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement about a million Americans, in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding will available in savings plans.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of hedge funds that were less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that two funds, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans for about 60 <unk> the rate of participation landed on the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choice, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for the ones that decided to participate, the bigger one was the number of choices, more people are likely to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more choice, they were more willing to invest in market market accounts for the market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to encourage to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences for more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that the decision, that <unk> even when this is against self-interest to us.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they saw it better.
The main reason is that we are going to be able to see that variety of giant <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for built, to contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to do this today -- four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test them in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, than today,
People always get upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, to get rid of the strange options -- there will be an increase in the sales, the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation eliminated the products for men that are less <unk> they have increased <unk> in <unk> by two greater sales and less costs.
You know that the supermarket camp, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store there are about 100,000 products.
But the largest tent in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce on the world.
In the world of financial status, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the David <unk> David <unk> program.
All Harvard employees are automatically <unk> automatically at a heart of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 <unk> not 300 or more.
You know people often say, "I don't know how <unk>
All of these options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This evening, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a couple of vacation with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> All right. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually hit her to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first turn, which in the second one, but I can tell you that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of choices, <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and the consequences must feel very concrete in a very particular way.
Why are people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards that when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting that were a meeting <unk>
And to that gathering, that we were doing exactly as <unk> we had a little <unk>
What we added was that I would tell the staff to think about the very positive things that we would have in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the <unk> <unk> show can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think about the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think about the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This schematic schematic is totally useless.
So the categories must indicate something to whom they were going to do not as the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge <unk>
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can drive a lot more information than we think about, if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision <unk> the purchase of a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows full <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> color in the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in the order of the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few times four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> at 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
What do you do in there.
If you were <unk> always the default button in each decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who go from many options to <unk> <unk> the default button and again, and another more.
<unk>
If you go from few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information looks like.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though you choose the box of changes does not say nothing about the preferences of interior <unk> in all of us and all of us have to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories of less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented with were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, for you, to use them in their own issues, or for people to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
I had to register a picture of example written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of someone who could do this, so much that this is the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big maker of any big manufacturer and it prints one page, that page ended up having some yellow dots on each page that you follow a pattern that makes them one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like a lot.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the Web.
If you look at what happens in the world online we can put up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we had money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, -- <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media using banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in a <unk> computer.
The secret secret of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this tells you it had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with the worse.
In the future, most organized crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, but they motivate them the protests, they motivate them all the <unk> they motivate them laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a <unk> role on online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the United States the U.S. governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> from the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the collapse of the last fall because of a <unk>
It was the safety of the site and took a <unk>
Last week, I asked, at a meeting with the representatives of the Dutch government asked one of the leaders if you were to say <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign authority of foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters based on the secret police officer in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale of the citizens of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros <unk> government.
The company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
They were <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to look at all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think hard about things like the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could be trust in our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, I live in Kenya, in the south of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying are warriors that protect our community and cattle, and they're also annoyed with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years is responsible for the cattle.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that actually this wasn't <unk> because it even helped the lions to see the pen away.
I don't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are really smart.  They came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were left, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found out that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that will turn out and turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> it makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give it out, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see it lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had the problems with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and she asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea is also used by a whole Kenya, to scare them to some of the other predators like Sean <unk> and it's also being used to get elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention, I had the fortune to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So, a year ago, I was just a kid in the grasslands, the <unk> cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes to fly, and tell me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be engineer and pilot when they grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electric inventions in the other.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make an electric <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that they were already invented electric fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: You know, I would do it once -- right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I have a couple of it, because I got a <unk>  CA: As Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We are going to <unk> in every single step that I would spend my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In the school, we took all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until it was all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
What I said, "When we <unk> this five member of the family will stop there in this world, because we didn't eat in the two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
It was very basic.
It was the first time I listened to people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a kid in his arms looking at the face of her mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about them and their families.
A huge famine left North Korea to <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few they survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They were also more and more prevalent and more prevalent the money, all around me was completely dark on the night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the river <unk> which serves <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life as a refugee refugee
But as soon as I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> me in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it doesn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and he answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another one, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of you can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Though there was eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape many other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can happen in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to risk them going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge of what I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call a pride of mine.
Even though I reached life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The American authorities in North Korea, some money sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be displaced to force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
And so I began to plan how to help you escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I went to the border.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to take it in some way, for more than three thousand miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by an official police officer.
He asked you all of everybody and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most low dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at the short distance of the embassy <unk>
I was going to come and come between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man asked, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind asking.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and to get them out of the prison.
I went through it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of stranger would have a new hope for me and for the village to be able to get it more than it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people are <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices in the English language of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family contact, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, <unk>
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center for representing something else, so they changed to the South Los Angeles as if this is actually wrong with the city.
This is the South Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home from the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to bring people more than the food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I would try to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see chairs out of wheels and sold as a <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, it was planting a forest of food in front of my home.
In a land of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters x <unk>
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to go.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> put us together, and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- <unk> you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of a group of a group paid by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city got me on top and <unk> and <unk> by saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order for planting food in a piece of land that nobody else would like.  And so I was like, "Well, let's do it."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> <unk>
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of terrain.
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's a space enough to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on earth don't seem like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand, 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South Center.
And I grew up there. He would get my children there.
I was pleased to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, me <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> on that canvas.
You see what the Earth can do, if you leave your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They are <unk> to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> on the night and were in my backyard, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt like you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when you see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> you don't know that people are going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
So that's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time when I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant with their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in voluntary plan.
If kids are growing <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you're growing <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this are <unk> if you're not taught how food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put them on front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're going on, I see kids of color that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't carry them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are moving from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you produce the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I didn't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What about sustainability is you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people out of working to people, you get to the kids on the street, who meet the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening out of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
The <unk> take their <unk>
That that is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to meet me, you don't call me -- I don't call me a little bit of <unk> and having meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material for driving, but not always, especially in days as today, that it raining very much.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you're parallel in your bike, and these cars go out, that's not very nice.
Furthermore, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads on asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can pass through it, so all the water water is flowing into the sides and you will have a road that it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water.
Noise will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the <unk> <unk> so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road the stones are going on.
First of a stone, then then several more and more and more, and so on, and you say, well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more harm.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage comes into this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> light, this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you're driving on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool from a steel to clean up, and we can cut the wool of steel in very small pieces and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of wool from steel in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is they heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample coming out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a little bit of a road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway in which we had to make a garage lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road last is going to last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made it aging -- we put a lot of burden on them, the aggregate of them, then with our machine <unk> and the aggregate machine and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have done a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, and even double the life of the surface of the road, they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool first before you can show you how repairability acts like.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's watch. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC News on his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban would be <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban ran out of Afghanistan and they made girls illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid to <unk> my older sister who couldn't be used to be able to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could be able to do it.
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going to be.
We had to hide books in market bags so it would look like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us stopped in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school was close to suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about them.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan, <unk> in which his daughter, my mother was to school, and so his father will <unk>
But my mother educated became a teacher.
This is it.
He took two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite <unk> despite <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate your children.
For the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. Can you try and leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want to do it.
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who took him on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I am in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what you're going to say, <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friends, they were taking care of them, despite each other, even though in front of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went off the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to your house, they are the phone, a voice would pick up that if I was still sending her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "I don't harm the future of my daughter for their old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were in school, remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
<unk> that these changes didn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a <unk> future and a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day, the girls of <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go to a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the U.S. revolution was inspired by <unk> mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a copy of the <unk> the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, up to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50 <unk> they were able to release our country and <unk> the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved it, along with many other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a political transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started to organize workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> a movement of women's women, <unk> orientation -- so <unk> to advocate for the autonomy of the woman and the <unk> to the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is getting away from the selfish policy of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was violent and successful.
Women won an <unk> of Congress in the first choice in 52 years.
However, little recently, the elation of the choices and revolution as it was <unk> every day we found news news.
One day we wake up with the news of the <unk> of mosques old and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we wake up with the news of the police killing of the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the <unk> and their hips of human rights of prisoners and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made up by a revolutionary mindset, it gets more <unk> and it's gone away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to tell you that we, as nation, we choose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize right.
Because the elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policy of domination, and <unk> for men like <unk>
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than the choices needed the <unk> and the <unk>
Our nation needs the depiction of the feminine of the female the most likely to need the representation <unk> and we used to use it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting it in practical practice instead of <unk> collaboration in place of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, needs desperately to reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which spans all of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes have <unk>
And so, just like the <unk> covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of it.
So this is what it tells us, "My <unk> is all about things."
This is what it tells us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That everyone is <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a overwhelming question that has an answer equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the ones that they all do very long for why she's left?
Why would anyone be going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
He was 22 years old, just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times the man, the man, I believed my soul <unk> <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> with bullets <unk>
The man, he loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University and I have a MBA in <unk> from the <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them.
I've been about 20 years old, married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is only happening in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or said in another way, in the families, the last place where you want or hope to find <unk> which is why, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who was going to sit with a man who sticks it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in the ages of 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway of New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college <unk> university and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a guy in the field.
I had a few big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me -- he was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, that I had a passion in helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like anyone had ever done it.
And it was why it was that <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go out of New York and let my work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I said, I quit my job and <unk> and I went back to Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head in a physical <unk> and a lot carefully ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where you were supposed to do, I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another guy put it under the pillow in our bed and third always in your pocket.
And he said he needed these guns to cause the trauma that she lived in a little bit.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message to me, and although I had never lifted me my hand, my life was really serious about danger, every single day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I set up the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what happened, I was sure that we lived happily forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had a sense of <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they would form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never hurt me.
I spent twice in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he was so strong in the head that I would spend various times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- he went through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold on the face.
<unk> followed <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying. at some point of their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk>
So, actually, I had a very good company.
So back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help us help me tackle the <unk>
The other question around the world is why they just don't get <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people do because we were to us, the victims, we know something that normally you want, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has ended up at the end of the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent engagement, even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> to the victim and their children, who are normally obliged for judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who was forced to their mother.
And we still keep wondering why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beating my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if he allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world: the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family and family, and I'm here today because all of you are going to be <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> the victims of the victims of <unk> women -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
Some people are a way to say, "The fault is yours by <unk> as if the victims of the world's victims who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and that they would raise their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of a very typical domestic violence.
I became marrying a <unk> and kind of <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and I have that <unk>
What I'm going to do is never going to have more, and they would ever be a broken pistol pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
Right now, they're just thinking, <unk> -- that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, to her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end up my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
Ground abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence, just throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the abuse of the light to the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family.
<unk> your vision of survivors as fantastic and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the actual signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed me like this.  Luckily, I have brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing in a stage, so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they die, they don't have to get them now, but we will find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
They are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater for your head, because it's when they're going to laugh for me, so you don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but they also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this photo, there was never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me that I <unk> the back and <unk> the hair of the child.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial state, like which I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our respect, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a big impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made it model is because I won the genetic <unk> and I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that is my <unk> <unk> that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold on, they're <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what would you really tell you to each of these girls is, Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> head of American magazine or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you need to be a model that is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike chronic surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get rid of your studies, and you have a copy and a few jobs on your back, no matter what I mean is, if you pretend that you want to be president of the United States, but you have to be president of your clothes inside for 10 years, people would look really weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was born, and also the first time he used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here's a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope that I'm not myself in those pictures.
They are a <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people from <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for free?
I have a lot of a two-inch heel. I have to use, except the previous couple -- but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
They set out of these privileges by my view, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their appearance no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the <unk> teenagers who are two and 86 percent of them were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me, <unk>
It's about how many times I <unk> and <unk>
When I find this talk for this talk, I learned that about 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent to 17.
So, the last question people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe <unk>
<unk> This is really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what I never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about myself every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair, I will be happier?
They just have to meet a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs and their clothes more to fashion but probably women are physically <unk> in the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain from this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image of the image of the success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion for me to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I wasn't myself who <unk>
There was no <unk> and no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum care in the lighting in light.
In fact, most of them were taken at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me out this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey.
This is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to get out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera into a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change life this journey.
It became sacred to us.
This is a picture of a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop the time in a October week and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always took the same photo, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceived and interact with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when suddenly it stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the plate of the plate of dolls that were <unk> from little at previous visits before.
And he described to me what I had about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that reminded of his heart is going to be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So, I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I didn't get out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I didn't get it to come up with someone and ask him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs like <unk> dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the <unk>  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>    So my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the Middle World, where we have 16 species, of these 16, 11 versus high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important, and first of all, provide vital ecological services -- <unk>
They are our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the carcasses to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They are helping to absorb the anthrax that not for them would spread out and cause great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there is no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge substantial importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the <unk> symbol and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto and the Under Egypt.
In the mythology -- <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing a few very important <unk> to open heaven -- in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural <unk> system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they are being rid of is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey on the consumption of cattle, which has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb for <unk> -- the number of cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not at wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focused on a domestic problem is not going to serve at all.
We need to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they <unk>
How can aid help? You can make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, you tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw <unk> without <unk> without the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I don't am.  I worked in Zambia. Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, everything that we had to do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we came up with seeds -- <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local people tomatoes and Italians and and and and and <unk> and and and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because of what they were told to come to them to come to work, and sometimes they don't <unk>  We were amazed that the local of the local <unk> had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't want to do anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato weapon would grow this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you do it, "You're never <unk>
I thought only for the Italians I had mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they did, what they did, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> will look at the waste that would give them to <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, <unk> countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
You just read your book.
<unk> of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners -- we are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to do any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture of a different culture, like my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The little bit is <unk> written by <unk> who said for everything about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided for 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never involve anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion -- the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it's feeling with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We put together in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has to have for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for one time, they would give them, but not in <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance they have <unk>
So, planning has this blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't close to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor family, the family doctor who has been involved with you in their house, at the table in their kitchen, and that helps you to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this little <unk> garbage in which we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so I get rid of you --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before you get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> said, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
planning is the kiss of death of the spirit of business.
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you with you.
You have to give you a little bit of privacy, and you have to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What talk about you have <unk> this tomorrow?
People <unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution -- not renewable renewables, and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a story that was a little bit of a little bit of a high magazine doing many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> got together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> by dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that was <unk> New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> generic companies <unk> <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in a <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a little bit of <unk>
Otherwise they're not going to talk to you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then then you have to tell you about the truth with <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have to tell a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be able to do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 iconic companies of the <unk> world, <unk> Ford, Ford, all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of them started by one person.
Never word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars with their dedicated dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this guy who talks about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what do you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't think about a lot of knowledge despite the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understanding our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for the stores of cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives us to the music.  there's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one of the most <unk> properties of the U.S.
I live near this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
He was sudden it was sudden it was sudden <unk>
I thought a lot about death, and I thought a lot about death, and I thought a lot about death for me.
And this led to me a profound gratitude for the lived time.
It gave the significant things about my current life.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch on the day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the old <unk> and new friends I transformed the wall of this left house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> <unk> of dying <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
And he tried to die from dying by <unk>  "Before I want to sit at <unk> in the line of <unk>
I tried to sing to millions of people."
And he tried to plant a <unk>
I tried to die outside the <unk>
And he tried to die to you once more."
He tried to go to the bailout of <unk>
And he tried to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh and <unk> me and gave me comfort in difficult moments.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> -- it's about giving us <unk> to the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center we did a kit and now have been done walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increase, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to maintain the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that would be given us more power.
And if you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can better reflect what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media and more media and more means to share, fears and stories, the people that surrounds us can't only help us better places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
No speech, but transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It shares <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter religious differences and think about this: it's never <unk>
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to <unk> words that I couldn't even think of, it reminds me of one thing -- how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that should be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk>
However, it's an selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I was able to pee on my arm during the first episode of <unk> and <unk> birthday birthday <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you don't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing -- which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary people.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual in each individual is a different way, which is so different as a Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development of development that even faster in the world, there is no cause or cure cure anymore.
I don't agree with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was just three years old, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new life in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was in the <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who looked at the world without <unk> a human that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact that they will be different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you might have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their interior and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the moment where we are trying to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what has been to be <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a teacher of communications would give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big unknown and unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what it would have felt must have felt sense when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with the students. They were surprised by the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenges from energy to environment, and health care -- each other, and if we don't know we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers were not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
They don't just tell us by simply studying the <unk> but you study <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when they're describing their science, carefully with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing to make dumb things.
Instead, as Einstein said that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise with ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're in ways of falling and <unk> with their content.
And when you introduce your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk> bullets and kill them and <unk> your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then to provide graphs that we would bring up to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of understanding what it is <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that he's looking for a public charge, no matter of <unk> platform or the platform, and when he won, he gets to the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and he said, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and eventually he had such popular support in London I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first record use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's literal one.
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions they could have <unk>
Some wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tested quality.
And not even it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a set of <unk>
And there might be <unk>
All the world got tired of <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper in a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
Which caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House were against the <unk>
The House House didn't want Washington to be power.
They didn't want to call it a King for whether it was giving him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> adventure.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will make it serious with a <unk> and insignificant title as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama has lucky enough to keep there, hoping that the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measurement is <unk>  <unk> you might go forward to wait for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important, and this is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have crossed the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was an uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads, etc.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to get to a <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really really changes a lot more words than these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet underground, in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is charged and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the darkness, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap <unk> of light -- they put it into the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a mining that I met days before, who lost control and fell zero feet on that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep end of that hole to risk their lives without paying a reward or a <unk> and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they might never will. Because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that has been involved with modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to such grade.
When we finished talking to me, I was very sad, I honestly was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me kind of like this, the stomach and weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
In some, I even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as many of the number of African Africans throughout the whole deal of <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> <unk>
But today, you can lend entire families by generations by <unk> by 18 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits of over 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then find that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met <unk> courses.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was <unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, in fact, <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks on their heads, to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk>
<unk> by the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made that they would just pee out a lot of <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was turned too hot to the touch and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, thinking, my camera is getting a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was at my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it, don't do here."
And he explained to me very clearly that demonstrating emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a proper situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for their release and trusted that he was going to do.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stones for a mile per <unk> to trucks waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids that charge and the children would take them on their heads with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were raising their freedom, the <unk> had completely cut their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness advised me to be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was scared of women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by a little bit of stairs which gave this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more well a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local and <unk>
They have small, private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven -- are forced to <unk> clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of it is dark and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
Back in the <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> <unk> and in that point, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs which was going to be <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and since we touch a subject that is so difficult -- it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex slave themselves.
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages in which there were whole families going on in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
<unk> hands of black, are the father, the blue <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and they go down the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We are still able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I was going to look at a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers, some young kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families, <unk> and forced them to work on <unk> on the lake, in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child has eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> -- that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of trees in Lake <unk> often catch networks and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are thrown into water to unlock the branches.
Many <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run and like all life has been treated with green, <unk> is about the slaves younger under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when we were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one in the way.
<unk> and <unk>
And it will be able to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to do it for a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the way.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the road and after walking around an hour -- what we found was the way I was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team out of photos on my head as they <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass of holes that I could fit in a football field and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children bound to their backs, and as they were looking for gold gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they were out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> since many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to get down to 90 feet and these people carry on heavy stone bags that then will be shipped to another area where the stone <unk> can extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer and forth on the margin we see to work at other lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When he died, his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of uncle which force force to be slave in mines.
When I met him, I had been working in the 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so severe that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream to be liberated and <unk> with local activists from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give witness to them and we're going to do everything in order to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to <unk> atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> They are of people, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens to me that I don't think about these very beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in those who can see them in people like you, and I hope that force will turn on a fire and that that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math mathematics -- and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management applications.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try and explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the more human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  we will see later.
But the debit demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably certain <unk> that well can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease stores gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, it was a robust, ballet ballet ballet ballet dancer at his time.
Over the last few years has been progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to be able to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we can know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure of measuring and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement have no <unk> and so they don't make blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials, they never do that has never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a journey to the clinic. What if patients could do the test they could do ourselves?
It doesn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is <unk> as a way not conventional to try, you see, in a certain sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy while it makes sounds when we speak. Can we imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet ballet -- because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs, to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed -- for example.
And like <unk> requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
So from the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as <unk> and as Parkinson's disease affects <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom <unk> you can see an example of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes happier and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both of the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, it's about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
It takes a cost so <unk> it's a massive scale.
These are some incredible goals ready to address.
We can reduce these patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for the routine.
We could often get data.
We could do a massive <unk> massive cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when we have the first steps in that sense, we are launching the <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these targets.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call low price and make recordings for each cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent six hours in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: And so I <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people will be able to say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking at the <unk> the factors of confusion for the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy at this point?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> have done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, as well, what we <unk> the project, now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were involved in the darkness, on rooms without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect -- we can do the impossible possible and <unk> and <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a talent with many years of experience and a picture of photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was <unk> -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen located in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level went over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the mud and we left the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons of fish dead, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places from villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to get out of absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> of the people.
It helped clean out the stall, <unk> <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And they had the honor and I had the honor of that day to <unk> to hand out the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going on, I myself myself as my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some who had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't help you think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got lucky enough and more <unk> and it took more <unk> so I walked back into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people were offered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to North <unk>
Once a week use our scanner in the real-time real-time libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time that you were going to do in <unk> is a different story, it depends on the <unk> of the photos.
I could get an hour. It could be a few weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand by hand using the areas where color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures would be in water, covered in bacteria, with seaweed, even with oil, and all of it along with the time I continue to get rid of it, and it was a big part of the project.
We couldn't get it to the photo unless he was clean and dry and was <unk> by his <unk>
We had lucky enough <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more photos already <unk>
As he said once, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures to get these pictures to the photos.
He had started <unk> she was stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and their own face would not have been asked by rebuild, -- we were able to put it into a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found pictures in a fire station between the rubble -- quite far from where his house used to be his house, but his colleagues will <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not as small now, but their two children were at school, in the middle schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his pictures his son was less about 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could find -- something that he could come back to look at, something that I could remember from the past that would not have been marked by March day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up by more than <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers from all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families -- hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in the ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, a loved one.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take us but the first thing that we need to look for.
This was about the project that I was trying to restore little pieces of humanity, to give someone your connection with the past.
When a picture like this would give somebody, it's not a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger -- to give something, using your talent to something that won't be thin skin models.
To finish up I'd like to read this electronic email -- I sent him the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I did, I couldn't help you think about the people and the stories shown in the images.
And one in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my father, <unk> <unk> hangs from our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs -- right?
Thank you. 
<unk> <unk> were inspired by wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on a millionth of one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion or a trillion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they're really challenging the camera.
So if I take a laser pointer and I switch on and forth in a second or a second one, in various <unk> to create a <unk> pack of photons just a millimeter pack.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common.
If we took that bullet and this <unk> pack of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --  Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> pack.
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started looking at these <unk>
A lot of photons finally come up to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble in the inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table, and because of the <unk> of the top of the top of the bottle, it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet bullet and current and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us sit down to see that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a bullet in motion.
And what about how to test <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture -- I was thinking, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full amount of this.
But if you look at once you look at this soup, you'll realize that, as the light gets <unk> of tomato <unk> is still bright. They don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato <unk> and the light is <unk> and the light is bounces back in your interior, and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera in the India?
As photographers, you know, if you take a photo to low exposure, it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest one, so you can barely get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took these data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something out of light on the door.
Where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly enough, slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good time resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser -- you can record a picture of <unk> which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the laboratory, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> <unk> with what's going on the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows on the line.
Or we could build <unk> that we could see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a order to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> of visualization to solve the problems of research in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, converted science in art, an art of photographs in it.
I realized that all the <unk> data that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see scientific visualizations but we can be able to see that we can be able to be able to see scientific visualizations but we can see that we can be able
To create a new form of computer photograph with slow motion and color matter.
And look at those ripples Remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> a second.
But this is also something that happens to happen.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these will leave us from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, and Einstein would have loved this image.
The order in which events in the world are sometimes invested in front of the camera.
You know, <unk> <unk> space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can be <unk> and gives you freedom freedom.
With a mobile cell phone, an crime of the humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a <unk> in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you can get famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering them in search for a change, they had a mobile mobile phone.
Who else has a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> a Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of all, virtually everybody has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my phone, and how it changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission on the E.U. I introduced a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, European company, every foreign provider of all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and up to two years, in your phone company or your <unk>
And in all of Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers <unk> all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret Eastern <unk>
And I also wondered if this really works.
They can store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask them, and I didn't get a particular answer, and it was all three of them.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a lawsuit on court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of the end of the end of it, you agree.
Would the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand and five thousand pieces of information.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I go through the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what <unk> data means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open It came up with this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and stand up and go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me about a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who send an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile mobile phone.
And the <unk> had known that I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who were the leaders, this never had happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk> <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not <unk>
When you go home, you get to your representative that only because business agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that are going to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello World, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello World, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we spread all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus -- my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
Just by accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a little bit of inspiration. And I don't want any of us in the room.
It's feeling bad for me, because at some point of life, they wish to be a disabled way.
Go for a walk.
Christmas Christmas, they're in the shopping center, drive into circles and what you see?
16 empty places was 16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial age.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York City, I can do it.
A lot of people with cerebral cerebral <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters older than my three sisters <unk>
If my three sisters were going to the public school, my parents would go to the school system and get rid of that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note all of it, the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another competition that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that I was able to get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a <unk> player, which has received a lot of <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be all of the family --  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk> <unk>
The people that I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
And I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eat, so <unk> <unk> at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, <unk> Is it crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to school <unk>
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were going to be <unk> as well.
And when my friends were going to pass on summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I was not going to go.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I would drinking milk milk -- I got married warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> the eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it into the head.
My parents would give up this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of the state of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
All right.
I made all the tasks of the least smart, took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass of <unk> my professors <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of it, they will end up <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they thought he couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that he had literally been born and gave a actress without cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with <unk> actors for <unk>
When I graduated back, I went home, and my first tour <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> don't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with disability.
They just embraced perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, I took the famous comics in New York to New Jersey and I never forget the first story that led when he fell at the realize that I was at the height of the <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs around the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East and <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they are really fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and at the time I remind the <unk> principals to <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight for the challenge of stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was kind of invited to the news program on cable back with Keith <unk>
I went to a graduate dance and I went back to a study and sat around in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I stood up with the speaker of the speaker to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like the <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells kids that children are <unk> but they never become a little bit of a girl or a little girl and a little bit of a little girl or a little girl, and it was never <unk>
All of a sudden, my online disability became the object of <unk>
<unk> clips online, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite ones, <unk> terrorist.
What does it have?
We really should pray for it.
A piece of someone's suggested even I would call my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make a <unk> then you know, you can't do someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk>
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media media, I don't think it will be.
I hope we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images. That will be less hate to the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet in the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> on the big state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The children of <unk> a charity to give kids Palestinians refugees -- a little bit of what my parents were <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know her story.
She lives in a little town in the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no jobs -- there's no work, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you give him a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They present a young woman.
Finally go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a sense of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city, was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a little kid trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for a opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing I arrived.
This was the first thing that he had called the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity for a chance, for jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> will be the story of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> <unk> thinking, and if I had never left?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support young leaders in a business race.
<unk> to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because because he was a college graduate student, frustrated, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations for <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point A B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> logging to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story about?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunity that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people in the summit of business initiative and how innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> of plastic from the abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for warmth, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink roses <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, to work for government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They had business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and creating a culture of business business is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in development and set their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources they need to support the support that they need to move from conception to creation, to create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park, and this is how it calls it when it's created, when it is to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the hat for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks Parks <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
<unk> forest.
The sun was made that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not the way that we were able to <unk> almost to pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with the heart of apple -- <unk> balls of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that they were too lazy as to get what they had <unk> who thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter like <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York City, the Department of <unk> <unk> our garbage, for 11 tons of waste of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and he walked through her routes.
I needed to get more.
So I began to work like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong one will be rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of taking on their body tons of trash all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the top 10 <unk> more dangerous to the country, and I learned the reason.
Are you coming out and entering the traffic all the day and they go down to all around you.
They only want <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the replaced of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is like a force of nature itself.
It doesn't stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that waste to waste are the most important work in the streets of city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a <unk> and effective way of every day, this starts to get rid of their containers and their dangers inherent against us in very real ways.
Control that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the motor engines start to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing at his relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed of everyday necessary.
So I mean by that just the speed that they used to move into the little <unk>
We usually don't care about it, and we don't know we cleaned up or we have our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bag.
We use them, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that it will be used.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste collection that maybe will help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a human and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always because one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste truck truck on the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his tour of paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's go right.
We're going to be good."
Soon after that I started to investigate the waste collection and I went back to the guy.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to count all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor of work.
<unk> waste -- what we think of when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean the garbage from you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is going on the connection to thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a business center, a number of stories in the capital of Ethiopia, hyperbolic <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the lining of <unk> generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a different climate that goes from 20 to 25 to 25 to the year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worthwhile to be so rich in culture, and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually taken out to the ancient market that is this structure of the open structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a new building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge came to the site of the site, which is located in a very much <unk> area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two street streets, which they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, bringing all the entries in the building.
And this spreads out with a <unk> <unk> which creates an outdoor space in the building that would spread out for its own shape of the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that will lead to the local conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk> of the <unk>
They have properties.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas that were not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center, and it wasn't what it is.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because ultimately there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
It's waiting for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a structure of a thousand years old that was surrounded by a 12 of a dozen of us with a dozen different access door with almost straight.
When I went to the place, the first paper operation that we did was expand the streets there, creating 12 early blocks similar to size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a heat difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's take a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to local rules that have a greater density in the upper levels and a lower density in the bottom plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving the community, the space occupied by construction.
It's where all of the neighbors, can you go up and get them up, and do such as a race for two kilometers in the morning, or jump from a building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people change communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that have the goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable as you see all the new girls.
I had great amounts of hair, very bright hair, and a little bit of cute.
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
I was a day after the <unk> of school, I was a little evening and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took out of the table of my teacher to school.
And then, I did.
<unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit of these.
All the time.  And I set up to my book to <unk> but see, some of my other peers had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows from <unk> and myself just a row of it, just for being there, because they were going to be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt really doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I never get <unk>
But most of all, I was aware of the reason that I was bothered by this little girl, and it was so good for <unk>
I broke the jealousy.
They are so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause for <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we would expect, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab where we study the <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost all of them.
This year is going to be a hundred years of his work, "In search of the time -- <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> all we could have.
We think about a kid trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget about the relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, that it gets to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a <unk> narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about life of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
To be the <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details would be <unk> to <unk> the knife right?
<unk> make us all <unk> novelists and that is something that I said, understand.
Everything that she does for me to give me pleasure could give the other pleasure to another time.
And it starts to say to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- it adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in your private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the <unk> of bright hair, and the cute little little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of jealousy, suddenly listening to the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover so defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think that this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or a <unk>
He says, "These really scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make it seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they are search of knowledge, search of the truth, a real painful truth, in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us to a much more profound range of feelings and vital that a wise man who can be able to <unk> us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> give us ourselves.
And there is some other excitement that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other excitement we will give us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a young young woman who was being used to the idea that her woman would get it.
And Freud said that there was something weird about that man, who was not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion with no cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or maybe accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels described very well as the <unk> make us look at intensity but without accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of <unk>
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years -- I think, but I'm also thinking about this story I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the one that would be sent terrible messages to itself, for a year.
For a year, it's all a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to tell you that when I or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big -- although we <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> <unk> who are trying to do how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to get to the <unk> of your self and <unk> from what you ever do, and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your rings, cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you the whole world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been able to say <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we would be able to do it, and it would be <unk> with <unk> in each of these puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you go in, <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he tells him there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to get your hand.
This is one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I find this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute is the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to <unk> that idea of being the <unk>
I could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to take the excellence in the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like the plans for <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, let's remember that we have fiction to <unk>
It's just fiction -- jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21st of July, he was Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the surface of the <unk> surface is the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the most mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars a day, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked 20,000 businesses, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died, including <unk> crew died.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which she swam after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the very words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> -- some ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn into our goal?
And you could also ask, why scale the highest mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly on the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're easy, but because it's hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the precious powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk> technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to possess what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship, or in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than <unk> 10, and <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> by looking at the problems that we think technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure a cancer, or feed the global population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't belong to the <unk> <unk> of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I'd come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that "Something's "Something's up with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists had <unk> and had enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't know the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation for us in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years in which we are <unk> Microsoft, and Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by the creation of ideas for the funding of <unk> <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investments of investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with a benefit in technologies as energy, which need a huge amount of capital, and that development is over the long term. They also have never invested in the development of technology dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have a commercial value immediately.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would take a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't fix the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent.
The coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want new sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of a <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the carbon price.
But there's no hope in the political climate that we'll see an energy policy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technological, they're not going to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of the failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and food <unk> but there will be famines as well as you existed.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The CEO rose to the war to the cancer of the cancer in 1971, but we found that there are many types of cancer, some extremely resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to be found now effective and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need to need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem: institutions should be able to support the <unk> it must be really a problem with <unk> and we need to understand it.
The mission <unk> which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it makes it with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like the <unk> solar system.
In general, going to the moon, it turned simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I'm going to turn to think that it may have dropped down in some activities or institutions and there could be augmented in others.
I don't have the clear.
But I can use the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the polls of opinion over time, there's not a lot of evidence.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway from the road.
But it's this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see is the attitudes of <unk> that people have been given when they're doing certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
Probably <unk> by asking, "What do you do that?
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> officer or kind of person, it's going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, I say I trust a certain teacher of elementary school that I know to give reading class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop side all of that knowledge when we think about trust in the more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they are trying to make the real judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who have their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> that then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> sitting or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment on how are people in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They are <unk> They are <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in raw materials and is responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it is going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not yet, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would be able to get their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still have not <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is <unk> before we trust.
The confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems from accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and so on, that we make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you can see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I will attend <unk>
And we found the same problem in our public and public life, and <unk> that the system of accountability which is destined to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard choices, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know a similar examples.
They were doing all of that, for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different than if they were to be worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> people who are safe and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple actions -- the <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to make the trust.
But the trust, ultimately, is signature because they give us some other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, it is because you can't afford by usually all the people, all the time.
But you also have to have <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That makes every day everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- he says I can <unk> without giving the explanations out.
I take them and get it back to me money, or they change them by the color that I want.
That's great. I'm confident in them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very hard thing to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when the other person is worth of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have come up with <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen in which the imagination is <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is to be able to transfer your physical body back.
Designers can take their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using the whole skill of the hands?
In the division of Science <unk> of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
They put a transparent Norden bombsight to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, getting into the inside of space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and try to highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down from every floating screen.
We architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and returned by the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in space, how we can make physical beings so that we can be able to <unk> and <unk>
How would this future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> we created this only physical roof.
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move into any place inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and <unk> and they have always in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and distance and <unk> by Michael Jordan you can reproduce it as a physical reality of the time we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating that changing the physics physics is figuring out how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not only going to show us something but to begin to act directly about ourselves as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us without us have to take advantage of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was amazed to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only a relative path to the <unk> -- a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera of Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio program.
But any adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was already too much <unk>
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about adult life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It was so different, and much better than you can do.
So it became my tool to get out of this trap <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find a new culture also led to my <unk> habit habit.
So let's get a lot of perspectives.
For example, this map I thought was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's to research fields like a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a issue.
And I thought that if reading comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books on two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and needs to <unk> Interesting.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people in the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back to feel like or powerless never.
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of sleep.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams are coming from, where the dreams comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly most of the time.
So the books always are <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
And Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> wine threw up on the couch of my office took off his shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first customer.
And I played a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex led to the <unk> became easy enough to move the head as they take the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later, home later, she has children later, to death later.
For people like Alex and I had a lot of time.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me pushed me to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under the category, they were <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if you marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe they were <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel the head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of intimate, benign problem was a real problem, and it had real consequences not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! It's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> they take the dream of a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years.
This means that eight of each 10 decisions and experiences and moments of <unk> that give her life to have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
People from more than 40, they didn't get <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or come out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up the second and the last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> the body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical time in the adult development.
But this is not what the people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists called the <unk> names to <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give you a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person to the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, the really interesting ones like you or their kids get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship, I'm not just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, went turned the music and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the guys here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of a little extreme, but you don't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, pick up a partner, and have two or three children in a very much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
You realize that you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother <unk>
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the ones are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it could be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but he still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, it lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living in a very difficult way, the previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she woke up with her as he said, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire time.
I had just bought a new book to <unk> and had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words -- "In <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if he gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade <unk> of Emma went forward.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every single man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told him to get rid of that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
For capital capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this -- identity capital generates capital of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> the <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that we shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the people who get together with friends with the same similar minds are limited as they know what you know, what you know, how do you think about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who will come out almost always comes from the outside of its closest circle.
The new things come from what they are called a weak ties of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the people have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half isn't -- and the weak links are the way of <unk> to this group.
The half of the work that has never been <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as he was <unk> Emma soon as soon as her family, when you have a partner and it exists in their own family.
I told Emma the time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is best age to sit down that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now -- or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook begin to walk into <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so <unk> in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or kill time with anyone who would give them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> <unk> of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped get a work there.
That supply of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> especially in museums.
This married man with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I send myself a letter that said, "Now the space of emergency contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplanes who come out from Los Angeles, <unk> who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fit on its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 to the 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years, or even in the next generation.
This is my idea worth spreading all the ones that have heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
So now I have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get our identity capital, using their weak connections, choose your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh degree in public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
Let me do tasks.
When I work back, I would make grades.
What struck me the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do in the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in a really difficult neighborhoods -- <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the more effective at improving the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, wondering what of these marketers are going to keep their work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, it emerged a feature like an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physics and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a good career.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires of determination and then waited around more than a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly more likely to <unk> even when they were <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of testing tests even the security results when they were in school.
So it's not just West Point or in the National <unk> <unk> where the <unk> matters is in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know about the science about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do the determination in kids?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't follow with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly <unk> is not related to or it's even related to the common measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that we developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they fail, because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that whoever is that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be helpful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw every one of the strokes in the <unk>
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy alone.
The first 200 of them will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read traffic signals, <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages.
Today I will start with eight to show you how this method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it can be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was screaming in a <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the ancient said, two are the company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a single tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two forward together, it gets very hot.
Three forward together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out over the horizon.
One door, put a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women put care is <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
When you use this approach, the first eight radical will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in the east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
An Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked on.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the Africa has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where you go out of it is a result.
This is a slide to remind you that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was his imagination for months.
Her favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial <unk> <unk>
However, the <unk> of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a rise of 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a little bit of metal -- and a <unk> guy who was a <unk> <unk> a girl who was wearing a <unk> of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician, of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the <unk> of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the <unk> of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I was watching "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son at that time.
About three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of supervision had <unk>  And so he slid in the room and I was <unk> in the room and I was very impressed as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke took a military to <unk>
<unk> this with the <unk> <unk>
How do he win Dorothy your movie?
I do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow <unk> OK?
Why is there so much force as much as low as well as the force in the movies for our kids, and so little of the path of bricks <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of the films of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss.  I think the credit time I really expected the credit to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search for me is finished, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and I would argue to the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, although they, kids, aren't really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend their <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies about war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all times continues to be appearing on classic after classic -- each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the two men who are getting a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has done a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let this <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not taken roots and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the <unk> of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> In the movie, there is more than a female character that has today?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the guy who like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality of <unk> <unk>
Right? <unk> from <unk> success from <unk> an idea of consensus what a Hollywood movie movie is.
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think it's going to be <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film happens in a embassy -- where men and women are hidden during the <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and profound conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them think they have actors that are <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number than this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's a massive entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children will have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely closely <unk> but something wrong -- and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero, is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very beautiful statistic and we want to get it to it.
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we expect that to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children males a new definition of <unk>
The definition of mine is radically changing.
You have read about how new economy is changing the role that you care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite <unk> character from "Star <unk> Do you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress of dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and fight and fight only and more stories where he looked at his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people better improve and be better people, like the <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I was more like was to look for <unk> <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are <unk> and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was invited to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles from length to the <unk>
I had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to using satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern region of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple sight, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using the fake color, suddenly the place looks like bright pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes in the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient conditions.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Roman Empire.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this big renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge area of <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved through this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random to look at a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So, we use NASA data data to make a map of place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this little small area that looks like inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with American scientists doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we are looking for human occupation events.
Five feet down, underneath a very thick <unk> layer we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which proves that there was a workshop <unk>
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the <unk> <unk> these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a shop of elite jewelry that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but it will go to the place in a nearby future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it -- TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas actually happen in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts <unk> <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now we would have a group of <unk> <unk> in bicycles.
They are competing in a <unk> race and they go in the direction to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying around everywhere, wheels that goes on their side, the rays of the wheels that ends up in places called <unk> the threshold of the door.
The <unk> to the hall, or what there's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
It's from his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
They can feel your blue <unk> the tickle on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you see it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained your living room.
Now in the room, and making some of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on his center <unk> singing <unk> -- <unk> One has become a <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a kind of yellow bricks and from the oven.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- they were looking at them just once.
<unk> the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
It takes full poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be a phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England, and he has one of the best memories of <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
Everyone involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to do these miraculous acts of memory using some old old techniques invented and invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that he used <unk> to memorize their addresses, and that the <unk> <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was: How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the classroom of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant one, even though a little <unk> said, <unk> you're an American <unk>
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of play in a deck of national TV.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that it wasn't even reminded that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how to point our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a bunch of treaties on writing over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having <unk> <unk> disciplined and <unk> was not a little bit as rare as you can look at this day.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that we have changed our cognitive use.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it looks like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> as this throughout the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of medical University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
But there was a really interesting difference between the brains of the memory champions and the people of the control and the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI machine, <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and <unk> forms of snow. They found that in the champions of memory <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of the competitive <unk> is driven as an armed career, where each year comes someone with a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the very precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the very end of it is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word -- I'm telling you, you know, there's a man called <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I'm asking you, you know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I went back later, and I asked you to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean nothing to you. It's no relationship to you.
With all other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
<unk> when they come back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They were hired as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give you a very good party, it didn't lead to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up foot, he got his memory poem and <unk> and so soon it was the classroom of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed all of us, but it shattered the bodies <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, single, unique survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single day.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were their loved ones between the rubble.
What you were going to do -- I picked up at that moment is something that we all know about more or less <unk> and that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and remarkable.
If you tell you that I was going to tell you that the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to look very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to tell you who I was sitting on the red car in their lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it from memory in the same way that he would have done it -- if you were invited to you if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image -- crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition is completely <unk>
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> put on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they fly in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk to be that strange journey that they did for a year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is like the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not word for word, which is going to confuse but, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase "The first <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something great about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But it's really like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking testing -- I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before sitting in the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of a old <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it is actually about to do is better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security glasses with tape, leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute to you to memorize speeches and phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. They are going to work on.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> of <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights on how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of you are not going to stand up there.
But the reality is, there's no shortcuts.
This is how things are done.
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today is what I want to leave you -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left it to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence of <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who are walking on our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even believe in the process of processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory skills in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so it was a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I was living there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And then they all spent the time watching TV -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, all of me looked at me and every time I got <unk> and I was wrapped up in a <unk> all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and I hated it.
I was going to take that journey, hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Right, right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or in the area of areas, but of those synaptic connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they are going to tell you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think they think about it in a building built two two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection that we've used this trick for a long time ago.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, and you know, he has a <unk> it has this <unk> columns, red brick that leaves <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the stock values history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, reading and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both that are that completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On the one side, the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new new solutions for life forms for current life.
We just gave it back and we gave them so much, that we get out of the people.
And all of the black, this tells us you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to these symbols <unk>
So we do, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started experimenting with <unk> we do swing the pendulum back to go over and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started collecting those symbols.
Let's get the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added the bake bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
You might have a little <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we add memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to make the pendulum swing in the other direction.
In the '80s, and in the early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques that stood up with a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that they were involved against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's <unk> and it's <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> back in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public <unk> were completely aware about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent when the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and I was everywhere.
He was our first star architect to star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was driven around them and quickly learned that these shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did do the major mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new third country happened with other star architects
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all of the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how to eat architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> they can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not very accurate to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I know if I designed four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you get to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it is actually <unk> the difference between innovation and <unk> among us, the architects, and you, the public.
We can now make almost <unk> symbols of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, was already part of the community -- and as the drawings looked like the exact same as the product finished, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal story, and that makes you <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building became built today, first of the Internet in pursuit of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell you that there's no single answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using words that are <unk> and drawings -- and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which is not causing something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can hear, and you don't leave them for architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical <unk> of red brick with ideas of what it must be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we can ultimately be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will be transferred to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to do sports or to <unk> or even one can be married in the night.
That means three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's no longer one customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we care about.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them to the more <unk> space -- the local libraries of households where we form our kids, and the <unk> to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does this very great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that most likes to do is look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives himself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he asked me to think, when stopped doing this?
How is it all of a sudden we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at user, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager only wants to be dear and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though her mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Amongst what her mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow people in school said, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and begs others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has got over 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenager, which gets these answers on one of the stages of their more emotionally vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand is <unk>
This environment, of being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of how they liked and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between living life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is to develop digitally.
What is the greatest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in one context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people are doing?
But the guys are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of sports, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals well <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities -- their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how we have to spend society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom in the classroom, <unk> participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call attention by their physical way.
One in five are not attending to classes at all the days when they're not comfortable about it.
And in the middle of testing, if you don't think you see you good enough, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently thin, <unk> a smaller note to the average of your fellow who don't worry about the appearance.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, and the United States and China, in Finland, and China.
And it turns out in fact, regardless of what these young people.
So, in order to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you not about how you really are.
The lower self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are making fewer physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy that they can bring them to a food disorder without food.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this by what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol of alcohol and drugs, diets <unk> aesthetics, sex relationships to ages and no protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is <unk> the health system and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they are <unk> again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present a job interview on one day that they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, what would that be that <unk>
We have this potential of interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only going to have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are very crucial points for anyone willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take charge in the way, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you see it.
We all can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing the whole person to grow up to their own person, valuing the individuality, diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really marking the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones who come out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be <unk> from being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who do you have in mind?
It's <unk>
It's <unk>
It's <unk>
Your <unk> <unk>
It could be just a woman who is two seats away from a distance. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he was going on for you not to have a long legs, <unk> <unk> <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this and we would claim that they will blame their potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is getting us all <unk>
But let's bring our children the truth.
So what you see is that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and for what they do, and as they make us feel.
They would go to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year old age will become based on insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
And they were initially told to they were, but when they were prisoner for other charges in the business of others, they began to plan attacks at about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans was <unk> by a informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the fishing bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be taken away from it.
Later, I would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was an engineer <unk> with an American mother, an American mother elementary school, the two made all possible for me to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam -- that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, you don't need a lot to want to want to want to want to wish the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of human group, there's always a little fraction of the people who were so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible media so that everybody lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to <unk> training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go to him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing -- our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me my father helped me hold the <unk> on his shoulder and explained to me how to point for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot gave him the little orange light on the goal and for the surprise of all, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a father, such child.
All of all, the comment gave them a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to me 20 times that instability during my childhood, not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was time to packing and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of the silent class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have developed social skills to put it very <unk> and it was not prepared for the real world.
I was happy to judge people, <unk> <unk> <unk> like your race or your religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they set up with my way to think, was during the presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys we had done friendship, myself was Jewish age.
I took a few days out to the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of friend and quite frankly, I was very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all life had been done to me believing it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a park of <unk>
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critical that I had seen in life.
Having been a little kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to deal with people -- exactly the way I want to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be <unk> but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
All nights Jon Stewart got me to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
In occasions, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy needs to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why decided I went out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, one day, who is going to try to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, but even though I give me to this ideology violent and <unk> I didn't get to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those <unk> acts as well as rejection of my father.
With this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. The children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film does taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a time of your childhood coming to your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your <unk> of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a inner movie on it, and you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I don't have certainty that you are aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies.
Why are we not just robots that are going to do in order to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
The science of nature, is objective here.
<unk> by nature, is subjective one.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
The psychology is studying the behavioral behavior, and the neuroscience is studying the brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even about 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists as Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work I filed Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do to do certain areas of the brain and what would be <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I don't have to offend the <unk>
There's no easy problem with consciousness.
It doesn't address the real core mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find the explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do we work with them, how do we work around, how they are <unk> they are adapting and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how target works.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk to how we talk, how we <unk> <unk> all of these questions about behavior.
But when it's about consciousness, questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> of heart.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it would work. For a long time, I beat my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to stand up at this point.
We have a wonderful problem, and we have a great thing, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware of.
We don't know how to fix that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness is right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't really know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, and I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here has one.
Her crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective movie is a kind of illusion or confusion.
In reality, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and so it studies all of what it takes explanation.
Well, more power to him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm going to go in a different direction.
At the time that we have -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> bricks and space and mass.
It takes fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties will not explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Rather, it becomes considered fundamental, and that's what the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- time, mass, <unk> laws -- so <unk> the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electric burden as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, mass, charge, then for the question of logic, you have to add the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness and laws that connect consciousness to other fundamental concepts -- space, time, the time, the mass, physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want to make fundamental laws that we can do in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws of simple fundamental laws that we can do in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> by mind, each system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think <unk> always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have any element of crude feeling -- some <unk> <unk> of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about it so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us -- it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more continuous with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that extend the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with the information.
Because there is always awareness.
<unk> of <unk> complex as in a human being, awareness.
<unk> simple information.
A very exciting thing is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> <unk> <unk>
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of data integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a degree of information integration of information, as a rather significant degree of consciousness fairly important.
But when you get to the pour microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In the theory of <unk> there is still a level of consciousness different from scratch.
In fact it offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that's underlying the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From vision, the equations of physics can be leaving as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there in the center.
This is a vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have quite serious social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some of you can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then he had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll get too hungry.
I think by thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical and moral terms, is not both the fact of consciousness, but its complexity and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated amount of information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are all these very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, we have a TED collective consciousness -- an internal consciousness for this full group of TED -- different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a universal thing.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will be able to find it.
Understanding the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low education profile.
I went to school, I stood up with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to be <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a mathematical problem.
She actually has no <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother's <unk> and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we took the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching me in a high school of <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the class 11 <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in wheelchair, they talk about things like <unk> at school?"
Right?
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire us.
And in fact, I am on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to do it? Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to the disability.
Yes, they have been sold for the lie that disability is something <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable for you.
It's not a bad thing, and you can't make it remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without drawing a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> <unk> legs.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will encourage people to benefit from people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that it is my life, could be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to realize that they think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are driven by people with disabled people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not that bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
And we would have some things.
But the things we do is not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I went to the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you're thinking, "Oh my God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, not <unk> that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to collect the things they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the mobile phone battery into the battery of your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and the resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stairs has never made it a <unk>
Never.   <unk> at a TV screen will not show the <unk> for <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we're going to be able to get away from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what one believes to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see reality is augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of reality, they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because reality augmented our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets them see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework for you to do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the field of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a little bit of <unk> <unk> we were trying to deal with everything in their self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's take some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A few times a moment.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the field of football, from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be his favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get rid of how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, <unk> I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What is the experience of a fan when I put a fan of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before the arm had been running and making a <unk> What is the experience of a fan experience.
So when it can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball on the bottom of the network? Or you would show you making a stick out in <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour, like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief refresher on the <unk> technology.
In 1965, the <unk> in Baltimore put a <unk> to his field of field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Others decided <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They were more <unk> because it was more fast, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to their group, and you see their next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they carry on. You don't have to worry about having a <unk>
or memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose themselves and they hate <unk>
If you lose games you would give you a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium by having a view from the high people that's below.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information you send to your players.
The good teams will be able to know about it.
The bad ones will have information information.
And this <unk> to the good pieces of bad equipment.
So your computer computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just <unk>
It would be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
They would take the ball and <unk>
<unk> to an open receiver -- suddenly a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> <unk> not <unk> but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
They went to the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open line.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor sees in its bombsight -- a area of grass that lights up and it can modify the race.
<unk> takes <unk> it takes and <unk>
The <unk> and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the countryside, <unk>
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this one to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality reality to encourage the empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> what are their actions from the <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live being <unk>
How much is it also worth a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we took and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I got the country to <unk> the southern tip of the <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> the chief chief engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of you releases all your concerns and pain, and the waters that spend under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to <unk> suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water roughly 120 miles an hour.
The impact is <unk> bone, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The people who don't usually get into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide is going to be aware of the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are going to get before they had their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its most dark time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success on her back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who did the suicide, but to the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, policymakers and psychologists train the new official new ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the Julius Julius last year when he got a call of a possible subject that was a <unk> subject sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an official <unk> officer.
Jason was just 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had been flown up to two times before New Jersey to try to kill himself from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and I sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could tell you, and she opened the box.
She was <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
She stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and left.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just had a life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the great day, the family rabbi called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason got the order.
<unk> damage to the suicide affect a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved to be <unk>
What do you find?
What does it say?
In my experience, it doesn't only have to talk about, but you need to hear it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't have to be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about ending life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost of the interest in life.
I came up with this talk a few days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I think you're at TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and told me that the Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been bad enough without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th of March 2005, I replied a radio call for a possible subject of the <unk> <unk> on the sidewalk <unk>
I was walking through the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing in the sidewalk.
When I saw me, it immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and the next half time, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day will come back and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did, and he gave the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "Do you <unk>
They stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the image of 11 March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
<unk> I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> -- when I visited General San Francisco Hospital at San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I knew I had it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, me theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who considered suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
Usually this is only achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've answered and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents where I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who was talking about an hour.
And during that time, I got my hand on three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few that have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have been told that the second one you leave the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not just connecting to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must work for to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There are help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inner side, you know what you are, and a question you ask you, how do you tell you about that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that he had finally achieved the dream that I had had from a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, that I will go back later, when I look at this picture I'm thinking, you know, you got it <unk> it was <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
All of us, our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my <unk> agent, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on my head.
And my mom said, "Why do you always take that shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never told me to share my story, not because it thought to be what I'm a bad bad, but because of how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day thank you to be a woman.
I have a mama, Dad and a family who just accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she said, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was sticking out of the <unk> and the wardrobe and that night, I won in a bathroom suit, I won <unk> <unk> and got a third finalist between over 40 candidate characters.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was the queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went into remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you give you the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to him to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most highly sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time in the U.S., we need to do surgery before change the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20th of November we make a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there is no longer <unk> than 20 of them.
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first of all, thank you to thank all of my <unk>
In my support network, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women <unk> that I have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that his parents couldn't take it, and I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just an identity of gender, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned a gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table on the subject that sometimes that task didn't block and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space to curiosity and ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National Prize of peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, just from the beginning, when when you were born, the birth is not <unk>
It's not reserved for her father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of a mother to get a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only nuclear mother, but the daughter. The newly <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school admits of her siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with his friends on the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you want to get away from his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that honor, I could even kill.
And it's interesting that this means of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of course.
And there's a more standard rule of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and they accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and people's decisions even if they don't want to.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like it, or if the <unk> with a old man, he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> too young -- it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to her daughter, and the same lesson of honor to their kids.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, incredibly <unk>
And so much before I found it, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for life for life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One invited to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where their potential is for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was born, the form of tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to put it on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomena.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all the political, economic and social <unk>
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are placed to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, I got up and got up for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper on the BBC, was offered to her for the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
<unk> like a <unk> all over the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign and at nine o'clock in October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I was interviewing my ear to my wife -- "I've got to <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't give you a <unk>
<unk> the fair cause of it.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path, and God <unk>
These few words would be very much for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was in the hospital, I was in the hospital, and I had migraine headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was held by the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children of children and women, it's like any 16 years old.
<unk> when it's not just his job.
They fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my <unk> who has done so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk> and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the brain science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined me with the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google X. But all the work that I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you a <unk>
You're still as smart or not?
If you're not going to be <unk> you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, of more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> to follow life.
More than once I've saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> because of what I decided to do to try to get the <unk> dose, because there is no really clear map to say it in <unk>
I started to test with <unk> <unk> and I was shocked to see how small changes in the dose -- dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I set up doses and classic chemicals for a man in mind, and I was surprised by looking at how I looked at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that I had in front of it, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they need to be <unk> since then I'm better with men.
What trying to do is how to adjust those hormones and these hormones and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my flow of ideas.
I think about it almost always in images, and that became my key reference point of how you can get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> and new ideas -- new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the ones who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works, to me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I was able to find the point right now, and I have a lot of lots of great <unk> mental <unk> really sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of cinema was able to use their imagination only to lead to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used an fMRI technology, an fMRI image to represent the brain here, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues of Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the middle is showing the scan of the brain of that same individual while they were <unk> looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves in <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions to the video video.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new new animals, and while they were so <unk> a new <unk>
The computer used to just use the scan of the scan of the scan to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This was going <unk>
We're fine about it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it creates the same picture, the same <unk>
This was done with the <unk> systems of larger resolution available today, and their resolution became a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer me that one.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even myself, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- we first need to ask the next one, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get larger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution -- not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and bright and <unk> and <unk> in the radios and perpetual radio <unk> in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field you can see magnetic patterns that replace the <unk> radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio <unk> we can increase <unk> the information that you can get in a single <unk>
And then we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands of thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even even direct neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas into a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more options than open this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not only the gay closet for you.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be telling some person for the first time they love it, or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other very difficult conversation that you have through your life.
So I think this is a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
Day fear, and we don't like it.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> that by the <unk> of my <unk> and I had my head <unk> I would ask me, usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, and it would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother launched a cold, look his son.
But I would not say anything, and it would go through it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time was prepared and was about to get to the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" that I <unk>
And then I took a deep set of deep down, and I went down to my back a little girl in four years with a pink dress, looking at it, which is not a challenge for a feminist <unk> just a kid with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I took a deep deep back, again, I stood up with him close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and he saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to wear a pink, and sometimes you like to use a delicate dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more from the kind of <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all <unk> <unk> <unk> You're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some cabinets in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the darkness, you can't know what the walls.
You just know how one feels like a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why we come out of my closet it was harder than his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared banking racing is harder than telling you that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder than telling your son of five years that you're going to get to you.
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop looking at what is difficult to be difficult for what it is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our cabinets and we need to just feel something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make it feel security, or less security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made about, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse, a horse, a dress and shoes <unk>
It wasn't the militant speaker prepared to fight any child in four years that would come up with coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet my <unk> <unk> and the move only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed by so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable radio launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> truck around the tables and finally got to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me was a few years ago.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and has never talked about <unk>
What is your TV show.
Our frugal program, Will <unk>
And you know who we were going to do with <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but he would try and try and show her desperately to help me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using a shirts, <unk> shirts, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a false sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never get rid of it.
And some of you can go out safe, <unk> by what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet I'm going to find a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very yourselves, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of is so interesting as the question if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we would have a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're in a alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're in a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that explained how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- <unk> stop doing it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately in the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the <unk> <unk> movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, since many years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices, with a <unk> force with the diversity of potential future accessible, Yeah, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the alternative options.
And so, having to tell this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
We hate the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that these universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> connection between the entropy and the intelligence -- the more <unk> relationship.
What happens if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy production in any system where you find it.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without the fact that it would be wrong to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a little foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for humanoid robotics, and human assistance technology.
This ability to use tools will be applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, the same as some other animals can cooperate throwing out of opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the <unk> model.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> to orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps the net well connected.
This same capacity of <unk> network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable on defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under its exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have broad applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you were a smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, in the beginning of the use?
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion of rebellion in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take the control of every future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, instead of being backwards.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to happen to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, is this: The intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the starlight and losing the planet we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space telescope, which measures the faint <unk> of the stars when the planets go over in front of them, and they block a little bit of that light that will happen.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother's star.
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the land planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their own suns.
At their time, this gives you clues about if these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the <unk> record.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a matter scientist or the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the business.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it's a little bit further away from the Sun, it can be an potentially livable world shown by a mission like the Kepler
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly that's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that the <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short flights flights but also the chance of <unk> to live on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the world's areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most <unk> and highest places on the Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried about this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets I shake with a big and sad <unk> and the implication and the belief and the belief that Mars would expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable Earth.
And so I like the exploration of exploration -- I disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is as imagine that the captain of the Titanic will argue that the <unk> of the Titanic will have place later on the boats that <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk>
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, "I know that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living in between the stars, lose the notion of how important is to protect the origin of the planets that we set up with this development.
It's <unk> to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and the <unk> exploration, they can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to dig the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where there was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and all were all closed.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had a early flight to the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but it's sure not more expensive than a half to a half night, so I thought, though despite the circumstances, I was going to be done.
I am a neuroscientist, a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm, and <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk>
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask me, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in their place, which would be <unk> that was bad things.
Or at least if things happen.
So I got to think about that, but to a month later, my thoughts would not be <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called a <unk> hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
They all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come from, and it tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then it tries to figure out what can do to prevent things to be or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you get a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the <unk> places -- where the tribes are <unk> where the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find your nuts.
And if you ask if somebody actually did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that mechanism very evolved to the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move very much.
This is the reason for losing your car, reading reading and <unk>
So at home, I was a place for keys, a hook along the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For her passport, a particular match.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it -- their things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take your cell phone a picture of your credit card license, passport, <unk> by email themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, that we will have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or the one to be dear to them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of the decision-making decisions and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from the one that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease attack the brain spill.
So you're thinking that having cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you know that you know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for most of the doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault of scientists like me.
We have not understood very well.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it to take a person?
300.
This is the research of the research researchers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they could avoid one of the heart heart attack, or a <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 to <unk> my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> pain pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, "The five percent is not very likely to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress doesn't think more clearly.
So think about how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug to help you the drug.
I'm not saying you should be <unk>
I'm just saying that they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the principle of informed consent.
We have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this needs to try is quite typical.
To the surgery that more is done in the older men of 50 percent of the prostate cancer, the number you need to try is <unk>
So this is 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a choice a lot of times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they shut out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face on the face with a predator -- you don't need the system of <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react to being the lunch lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the kind of rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we need to get them to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent bad things in the first place.
They put on <unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination along with the door, with a key to the front door, a very easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I have not seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: This is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there it looks like no matter how many thousand and thousands of <unk> can be -- never going to be a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1980s, and over the time, mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So, it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> <unk> behavior.
So how do the sound mean.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating sure you don't have the <unk> on the <unk>
All of this is what I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm a <unk> <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about which it's coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces, and while I was going from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my art of art.
It goes to me more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that they don't just experience through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all I had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck with the number of support and attention that I got.
I realized sound is like money, power, the social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could get to me and my artistic work, or my artistic work, or my artistic job.
I chose to make me angry.
There's a massive culture.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can be able to support myself and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a time time of value -- something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could stand up in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't capture and express completely on the paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals like sound.
I'd like to share with you a <unk> metaphor for you to understand better how <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters are different.
If it's mapping a different <unk> for each finger while it touches the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the shape of the body, the shape of the hand and like that, while the piano, English is a linear language as if you were <unk> just a touch at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in order to express a very clear idea or an idea of <unk>
If just a key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing is happening with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters that can be expressing different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and you would fold it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is <unk>
If you put it up, and you put the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said, <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents the time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is to take a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk> <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> the same time."
Look at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of your hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
Everyone with high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as a chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the language languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, third. Please take it back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they transmit very different forms.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start to question what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> and you need to hear the music.
The <unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to try to open up your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble bubble -- I should say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning up the others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but now over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we put those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge ships.
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work with <unk> so that the children really <unk> can also participate.
And I will tell you, kids who are making electric tools feel great, and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I'll leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids get a lot with the robots.
And then we started rapidly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before a lunch.
And we will transform light lights, and we put it into MTV robot and put it into a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating down slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We had this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I want to investigate my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it's <unk> with this one.
A child, maybe under 10 years ago, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil are also brown and when all of you are <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what there are in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help a remote form to other children.
I'm forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more away, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and even closer to me.
I'm half a Japanese half a French and a French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he created a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a full nuclear station close to water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons -- are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like the most part of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the most part, of the time, it has to be sure, is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course I don't know the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we put in the center of <unk> here you see the use of different jobs.
It might seem like they didn't have the serious job, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organize a civil expedition the nearest to the top season to the date.
We get up to 1.5 miles of the nuclear power, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a tracking device as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem with a remote problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much so small, so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical shoes, basically you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We questioned things like, we can invent the future of mobility <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in mobility of the old age population transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and the <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens -- scientists, creators -- we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures.
One is made from thousands of steel, the other of a silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one I thought so.
One is designed by nature, the other of it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that they needed for every cell to function and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our electronic assumptions are thin with light-activated pore.
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
You acts primarily as a filter, the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> there is no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality by the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world <unk> twice as much a designer of every designer and an architect to work with the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and analytics and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in his very simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, Why now?
Why couldn't this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they are dealing with four disciplines that give designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, <unk> structures and tools through scales, large-scale arm like this robotic arm with a 24-hour basis that someday that one day not very far to print and print buildings and graphics that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is the only big way to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with a 3D printing dance <unk> we printed this layer and 3D skirt between the cells. I will show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution of resolution and to the <unk> instruments that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair at the very structural and it also absorbs sound.
Professor Carter <unk> came back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern, it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the points of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, like nature, varies its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God shipped to the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, branches sheets and <unk>
All the tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made trees growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made over.
I often ask myself, "What would the design would be if objects were made from a single piece.
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we're looking for the material -- the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by <unk> or shrimp, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune their properties, we could make <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations -- we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that built a system with multiple fog <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a half a half miles long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are lists, it keeps them dry to find a natural way to contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of printing. They were used to contain microorganisms, <unk> that first first on the planet ago, 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT <unk> the bacteria genetically engineered to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems and <unk> and if it extends even more to windows.
A <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> table, we made our own <unk> table, new forms of life created <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and the <unk> <unk>
And second E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One becomes the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two plates don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help us to <unk> these bacteria and that they will <unk> their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> more <unk>
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch out of one end to another, it is 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in life inside your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We're a fashion fashion -- only half is <unk>
What happens if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the chronic tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer made it in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture in which it was <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the <unk> putting those fibers into each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
And the tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, are in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with sensors with sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm from <unk>
However, by putting silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a project and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different different environments -- and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often get <unk> silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we can shape the pure silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we had this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, doing <unk> and we put us on our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to become more dark and dark areas so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, pointed out silk worms about the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a farm farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and while they were <unk> they were <unk> and they were <unk> and the life begins again, and it starts again, like us, but much, much further.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
As a biological silk -- about the silk <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion for integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms are <unk> <unk>
In a curious, symmetry, This is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to turn to the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two material ecology designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new age of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the design that requires us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they were asked for the first time this?
They can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and he was able to see websites and then he was playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this sense of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to move on.
But then I was going to tell me about something else, something totally different, and I was going to get it on it, and I let me absorb and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it out.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern has been a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, breathing all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me for not <unk> at all.
I worried about having a fear of commitment, or to be 88 or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have ever gotten back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where we have learned about the culture.
What do you want to do is what you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to do to that age.
It's considered a <unk> thing to make nice answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as you grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute way before you get away from sleep.
Why?
If this question is inspired to children to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adult adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he's a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned in <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What happens if there are many different issues that wake up with curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And you can feel that you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that to say.
It could help if you divide into three <unk> multiple <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance the ideal was who I was doing well in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared in cartography, visualization of data, traveling math and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this single idea by its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And the <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower, is learning fast.
When we were <unk> we are <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> to complete time and independent writer <unk>
As a child, they had an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I became a writer, it was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when he started his thumb, and this ability helps to write a compelling string for the editors.
They rarely have a waste of time to go to what you would ask you, even if you end the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. That is the ability to transform anywhere you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, but a few other pages designer, sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> magazine, Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that are able to engage with the market needs of the market that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they're in your heart, <unk>
<unk> the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong on you.
In fact, some of the best teams have a specialist, and a <unk> <unk>
The acoustician can dive deep and put in ideas ideas, and the <unk> offers an breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and careers that are going to deal with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them are told to just be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you can take away from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal banks, whatever it is.
If you're a heart heart, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of yes.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes, --  I say, <unk> with their own passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
It brings up our inner wiring that leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world will be <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, they had a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more surprising.
If <unk> had been living today, we couldn't give her more help than the <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for the cancer for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But little of us have been progress in treating disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's since a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's will be almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend their years with Alzheimer's disease or helping take care of a friend or to be dear Alzheimer's disease.
Only in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs of five times by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and social challenges.
But it's been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 people's earliest causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one who can't be able to cure or to even slow out their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's that from other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a number of annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with the heart of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to making a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reducing a significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds on, these dots are <unk> they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are <unk> they're left in the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of what step would block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the pump <unk>
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of them have reduced the wires and waiting for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, physical, physical, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see it moves normally.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules that stick in each other within them, as we humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms to the early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial results, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to assume that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we think about it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, companies and <unk>
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for the change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain is running the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
It was <unk> this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The article about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience of testing myself as a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number one: When was the last time you're going to go back to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me, <unk> your partner what you like to like it, or she or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I first came up with this study, a few years ago, one detail really struck me the way that two of participants had married six months later, and invited me to all the lab to <unk>
So, I was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to get it out.
However, we got <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, keep still asking, follow them together.
And the reason I think I think about this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before he was published, the article was very nervous.
I'd been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousands of views.
And that came up with a very good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But because there was no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night at night, and since Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, I had been called the USA USA and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing that it is about own <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that life love of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or writing, what they did every day for weeks, they were the same question: they still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And many messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman yelled up to the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for St. <unk> that included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first momentum for all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both make a public emergence together.
We put on TV interviews, and <unk> orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons in the <unk> of the <unk> process -- a range of which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked -- they wanted to know whether it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love -- not only an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and he felt, mostly the wrong question of the wrong question.
How do you know if we were <unk> or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was able to zoom in interpersonal students, in college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It sounds romantic right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt more close after doing that, multiple <unk> studies also used the protocol <unk> <unk> as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used it between people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom I <unk>
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I first came up with the first time when I was 29 and was through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went into science.
And I was doing everything that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that it could be a certain way to <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just did for the book to write but in retrospect, it seems to be really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I used to feel like then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I was.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than they can help me demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is a guarantee -- not just to be <unk> today and <unk> tomorrow, but that will continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to be able to mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love with us to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that says, they still follow together?
And your content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let me ask you questions more difficult, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with doubt in your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we <unk> we still continue together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love -- it's not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I had not considered everything that one choice.
I didn't see how many times we have to make that decision, and how many times I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before, if he always would be choosing or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded by 36 questions, have chosen to love someone as generous, <unk> kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done in change, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe true.
And what I want, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't have wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also would be love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian in full mountain and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
Something that really affected me in New York City a while.  Something that really affected me but more details to me later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he took a bill from a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species -- ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's got grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> which was a <unk> <unk> and a bee got <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of honeybees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite thing happened: it somehow seemed to rise up of size, as if it was to get the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, strange bottles that I was finding around the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing the same thing that you do about a dead body on the scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, let's get some idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of nature's size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing -- I would <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the layers of glass, similar to the drawing on a window and then on another window and a window and a window and it had all these windows that make a three-dimensional composition there.
And this really works, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was a very big piece, which I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a lot in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It has twice a face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed by the <unk> ready to kill <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> -- bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits oil in a hand while in the other hand you get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of a story.
That's your hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> line on a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail does fire to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go -- you know.
Her tail ends up in a <unk> eye balloon.
They have <unk> them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or <unk>
But each of you acts as a kind of file in a way of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm carrying up years.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1,500 pounds with a human inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, and it's the <unk>
I'm going to show them for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest and he covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick retrieval of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a broken body in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue in the head.
There's a small forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a writer, a radio, a radio, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> an editorial arm, which spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
They put up the box and all the people in strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you're <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we came up to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has a effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug would be able to make a effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs -- these are the way to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and to increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in its most negative, because in the time that it takes you to get to the current. You get <unk> and worse still because of the time it takes it to its fate, which is where it's more important in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs, which is a treatment of life run by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to do the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for wounds and diabetes surgery -- you can be used for anything <unk> including the drug transport of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill into extremely small holes that open and closing -- almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
You can ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little powerful beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, applying it to the human body.
How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three head.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> military organizations like terrorists, or insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these generators generators and study ways of encouraging the transition of violent participation to violent confrontation by confrontation not violent.
I'm doing field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors and actors.
For example, from <unk> arrangements of peace between 1975, and 2011, <unk> was signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, how do they do, but nobody looks at what do you do when we don't get it.
The armed struggle and political struggle was <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Likewise, the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking again.
They took a complex machinery of communication stations, radio channels channels online and Internet web websites and social media.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising fundraising fundraising business -- for example, companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build your brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they run a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't mean security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan held by the war or the <unk> the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to see the efforts of these groups for safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high price rate for the population.
But in general, to provide social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 by Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at groups -- we only think about the violent <unk>
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill themselves gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the more complex ones are these organizations, we can less <unk> as a way to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a ground, they run all of their functions, collect the garbage, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and we live in a world of food and hybrids and the more weak states are states, like in the Middle East, more in the Middle East and fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more on military tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better <unk> groups we will better understand what incentives to offer to help the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- the military power can win some <unk> but we won't give peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security, to fill that <unk> of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a very beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist guy.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I am <unk> but quite bad.
And so I was so <unk> as a bad feminist feminist thing.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that we have sex.
Today, I see how women are treated in all the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist person.
It will be labeled like feminist was a <unk> a word taboo and nasty.
I was amazed as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or top of a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine someone else.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as being free to <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need to <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have to count our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and so much more.
We need to have to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that matter what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist issue.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear rap rap -- at a volume.
Although the letter degrades to women and struck me, the classic <unk> classic <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely wiped out of my music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of <unk> the <unk> and the maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and very nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> tales of <unk> <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it is his election, and I'm not a person to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their kids, I don't find that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same election, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> Darwin's feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the workers, gay workers, gay women, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist nerd.
It also happens to the following: <unk> <unk>
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we're going to be able to call it seamlessly.
When we get rid of them, they really love them very much from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative innovators and leaders in the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing foot and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear of what that tag is, for fear to not be able to fulfill with a little bit of realistic.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist feminist feminist feminist in the last few years.
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> three feet tall.
It was a show of <unk> to see this pop star to take openly feminism feminism and make women and young men who be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics began whether they were <unk> or not precisely the feminist age.
It takes his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult wife and <unk>
<unk> perfection is <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go beyond critical criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until there's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or more good, one feminism is <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give you a day, going to action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they change the change to affecting the change of affecting their profits.
It's certainly difficult.
Why does his music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions make this makes it more difficult for women to achieve gender equality, equality we all deserve to us, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant and also <unk> I want you to grow in a world.
Where they are excited about how strong creatures they are.
I think of them, I think of them, all of a sudden the best choice would be <unk> as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, especially male white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his project, participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also afford to be even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions are going to the top, to the people in the power of directors and producers of cinema and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage our feminism, -- good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist feminist <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because I think, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A little bit of kids told me, when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And so I went back to <unk>
I was involved in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
And through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a bit brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that all of us can be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border.
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But at a moment, it wasn't the article that caused the argument about autism and the <unk> <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put their children in danger to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it, they create all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were been stable as only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started <unk>
For fundraising fundraising for <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could do it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact of it.
If the <unk> criteria they had to do -- why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on public public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were dam by <unk> as when you don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that I'd seen less than 150 cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he got <unk> that he had turned to nine in 10 children to their office to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold fathers and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have stayed carefully on a refrigerator that didn't get <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they cluster together in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents are desperate to get their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two autistic generations were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, in London, I thought that the theory of mothers were <unk> was quite stupid.
She and his husband John was John <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl like black-eyed Without support, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend in the National Foreign Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse ones.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did anyone not know about these children before?
But then I was able to find a reference to a paper published in German in <unk> the next year of <unk> and then it was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English one, but fortunately, the husband of <unk> he talked German, and he <unk> him for her.
The document offers a alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes, with music, and kids followed their games by the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described described as <unk> disability for life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces during the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic like patients, Asperger's calls them their little teachers, and he went to help the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> have seen autism as a continuous continuum that included an amazing variety of sizes and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> in the pop culture as the <unk> and the <unk> and the teacher <unk>
He was more there to even say that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of 80 and early '90s, their changes were entering <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fell in <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked for you to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents from everybody knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first simple clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics began to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were expected to be used to it, and so he went, which is that the people with autism and their families finally support the support and services that are <unk>
And then Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a very powerful and <unk> history that was such as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention than one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and they suffer from a attention deficit for detail.
<unk> autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding the teachers, employers who are in the understanding of teachers, employers who are in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As opposed to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain or to make a brain.
Thank you.
